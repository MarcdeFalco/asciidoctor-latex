Mark terms like this if you want them to appear
in the document index

Assuming that your document is `foo.adoc`, follow
these steps to make a version with an index:

- `$ ruby make_index.rb foo.adoc`
- `$ asciidoctor-latex -b html foo-indexed.adoc`

The rendered file will be `foo-indexed.html`

NOTE: The index feature of Asciidoctor-LaTeX experimental.
It is designed to be syntax-compatible with the
corresponding feature for Asciidoctor when
it is released.
