{adl} defines an extended mathematical syntax
for the Asciidoc markup language
that closely parallels LaTeX.  To render
documents written in {adl} into HTML or LaTeX,
one uses the {adlp} processor.
It is used in the same way that
 the {adp} processor is used to render
{ad} documents into HTML.

roughly increasing order of size
and technical complexity.

* A guide to the <<Installation, installation>> and use of
{adlp}.

* An <<Asciidoc-LaTeX,introduction>> to the {adl} markup language.
Here we give a few examples and principles.
For more examples and more detail, see the
{adlm}.

* A <<Converting to LaTeX, description>> of the
mapping given by {adlp}.

At this writing, the mapping
is (quite) incomplete.  It is nonetheless
suffcient to translate most of the
material on {ns} into LaTeX, e.g,
this {article}.



* Overviews of the design
of the <<Design of the Asciidoctor-LaTeX processor>>.
This will be helpful
to anyone who wishes to fork or maintain
the code.

This report is a work-in-progress.  I will
extend its coverage of the above topics
as time permits.


Asciidoctor-LaTeX is developed by James Carlson, Jakub Jirutka, and Dan Allen.


== Installation

=== Using Rubygems

There is a development release at
https://rubygems.org/gems/asciidoctor-latex[RubyGems.org]
  Beta alert!

=== From GitHub

If you would like to install a development version from the repository, use:

 $ git clone https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-latex.git
 $ cd asciidoctor-latex
 $ gem build asciidoctor-latex.gemspec
 $ gem install *.gem

=== Commands for rendering

Asciidoc math files can be rendered

* as HTML.  Use `$ asciidoctor-latex -b html foo.adoc` to produce `foo.html`.
With this command the Asciidoc-LaTeX syntax and extensions will be rendered.
* as LaTeX.  Use `$ asciidoctor-latex foo.adoc`
to produce `foo.tex`.


=== Switches

Switch `:stem:` processing on by puttinng the text `:stem:`
in your file.  To turn the switch on and set it to `latexmath`, say
instead of `stem:latexmth`.


== {adl}

{adlp} supports two closely-related
math formats, [blue]#Asciidoc-LaTeX#
and [blue]#AsciiMath#.
In Asciidoc-LaTeX,
one can write `$ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 $` and
----
 \[
    e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1,
 \]
----
for in-line and display mathematial
text, respectively.
You will need to express dollar-denominated
currency using
escaped dollar signs, as
 in the sentence, "He paid \$100 for that
theore.m"  In AsciiMath, one writes
`+++stem:[ a^2 + b^2 = c^2 ]+++`
and
----
  [stem]
  ++++
    e^{2\pi \sqrt{-1}} = 1.
  ++++
----



=== Asciidoc-LaTeX environments

Asciidoc-LaTeX supports an `env` construct that maps to LaTeX environments.
Thus
----
[env.theorem]
--
There exist infinitely many prime numbers.
--
----
renders as an automatically numbered theorem.
Environments can contain in-line and display mathematics, e.g.,
----
[env.theorem]
--
A two-by-two matrix is invertible if
its determinant is nonzero, i.e., if
\[
  \left|\begin{matrix}
    a & b \\
    c & d
  \end{matrix}\right| \ne 0
\]
This result extends to $n\times n$ matrices.
--
----

There is complete freedom in parameter `NAME`
of `[env.NAME]`, Thus,one can write
----
[env.definition]
--
An integer $n$ is *prime* if (a) it is not
$\pm 1$ and (b) it has no divisors other
than $\pm 1$ and $\pm n$.
--
----
or
----
[env.joke]
--
A mathematician, a philosopher, and
a lawyer met at the local bar
for a drink.  The lawyer said ...
--
----
One can make cross references by labeling
the environment as in
----
[env.joke#mathjoke1]
--
A mathematician, a philosopher, and
a lawyer met at the local bar
for a drink.  The lawyer said ...
--
----
then referencing it later as `<<mathjoke1>>`.

Certain environments receive special treatment.
For numbered equations, use `[env.equation]`
like this

----
[env.equation]
--
a^{p-1} \equiv 1\ \text{mod}\ p
--
----

For sets of equations, use `[env,equationalign]`:
----
[env.equationalign]
--
A & = 4\pi r^2 \\
V & = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
--
----




=== Click blocks

Click blocks are similar to `[env]` blocks exceptiipoo that the body of
the block is not displayed until the user clicks on the heading.
The heading of a click block is displayed in blue.  Once a click
block is "opened", it can be closed by clicking again on the heading.

----
[click.comment]
--
It is sometimes useful to "hide" a comment
in a click block so as not to unduly
disturb the flow of the prose. Click
blocks are also useful for problem sets,
since one can make hints, solutions, etc.
clickable.
----


The default for click blocks is not to number them.
See the file `click.adoc` in the `exampless` directory
for more information.



== Converting to LaTeX

=== Inline mathematics

The text
----
  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
----
is rendered as
----
  $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
----

=== Display mathematics

The text
----
 \[
   \int_0^1 x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1}
 \]
----
is rendered as
----
 \[
   \int_0^1 x^n dx = \frac{1}{n+1}
 \]
----

=== Currency

The source text

----
Some finance: that theorem costs \$100!
----

maps to

----
Some finance: that theorem costs \$100!
----

=== Environments

The `[env.FOO]` construct in {adl} gives us
a way to mimic the
----
\begin{FOO}
 ... whatever ...
\end{FOO}
----
construct in {tex}.  The variable FOO can
be something familiar -- `theorem`, `lemma`,
`definition`, etc. {adlp} provides
default {tex} definitions for the
most common of these. You can override
them with your own defintions and you
can you can define environments for special
needs, e.g., `[env.joke]`, `[env.objection]`,
etc.

This said, there are special environments
built in to {adl} which receive special
treatment.  We thus distinguish two
classes of environments, _Vanilla_
and _Special_.

=== Vanilla environments


The `[env.theorem]` environment
is a typical vanilla environemet.
Thus, the source text

----
[env.theorem]
--
The equation $a^2 + b^2  = c^2$
has infinitely many non-proportional
integer solutions.
--
----

renders as

----
\begin{theorem}
The equation $a^2 + b^2  = c^2$
has infinitely many non-proportional
integer solutions.
\end{theorem}
----


Vanilla environments can contain
display as well as inline mathematics.
Thus, the source text
----
[env.theorem]
--
\[
   e^{2\pi\sqrt{-1}} = 1
\]
--
----

renders as

----
\begin{theorem}
\[
   e^{2\pi\sqrt{-1}} = 1
\]
\end{theorem}
----

Vanilla environments can take a title,
as in this example.
----
.Euler
[env.theorem]
--
\[
   e^{2\pi\sqrt{-1}} = 1
\]
--
----

It renders as


----
\begin{theorem}{\rm (Euler) }
\[
   e^{2\pi\sqrt{-1}} = 1
\]
\end{theorem}
----

To label a vanilla environment for
cross-referencing, do this:

----
[env.theorem#euler]
--
\[
   e^{2\pi\sqrt{-1}} = 1
\]
--
----

To refer to this theorem, say
`<<euler>>`.

=== Special environments

For equations we have the special
environment `[env.equation]`.  The
source text

----
[env.equation]
--
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}
--
----

renders as


----
\begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n}
\end{equation}
----

The fictitious derivation

----
[env.equationalign]
--
  a &= b + c        \\
  a &= (c + d) + d  \\
    &= c + 2d
--
----

renders as


----
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  a &= b + c        \\
  a &= (c + d) + d  \\
    &= c + 2d
\end{split}
\end{equation}
----

=== Sections



The source text

----
== Section

=== Going down farther -- subsection

==== And farther still ...

===== Yikes! We have hit bottom!!

----


is rendered as

----
\section*{Section}

\subsection*{Going down farther — subsection}

\subsubsection*{And farther still …​}

\paragraph*{Yikes! We have hit bottom!!}
----

If we precede the source text by the code

----
:numbered:
----

we turn on automatic numbering and get this instead:

----
\section{Section}

\subsection{Going down farther — subsection}

\subsubsection{And farther still …​}

\paragraph{Yikes! We have hit bottom!!}
----

To turn automatic numbering off, insert
this code:

----
:!numbered:
----

=== Lists

----

is mapped to the {tex}

----
\begin{description}
\item[Foo]a lambda expession of the first kind
\item[Bar]a lambda expressi of the second kind
\end{description}
----


=== Tables

The {ad} text

----
|===
| Eggs | one dozen

is mapped to the {tex}

----
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
Eggs & one dozen \\
Potatoes & nine pounds \\
Milks & three quarts \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

----

=== Bold, italic, and monospaced text

The text "She said _potatoes_ but he said *potaatoes*", written
in Asciidoc as

----
    She said _potatoes_ but he said *potaatoes*
----
is mapped to

----
    She said \emph{potatoes} but he said \textbf{potaatoes}
----

=== Quotations

The text

----
    [quote, Abraham Lincoln, Soldiers' National Cemetery Dedication]
    ____
    Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
    on this continent a new nation
    ____
----
is mapped to

----
    \begin{quote}
      Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
      on this continent a new nation
    \end{quote}
----

=== Footnotes

Text like this
----
    Ho hum.footnote:[An expression of boredom]
----
is mapped to

----
    Ho hum\footnote{An expression of boredom}
----

=== References and labels

The label

----
    Ho hum[[foo]]
----

is mapped to

----
    Ho hum\label{foo}
----

The cross-reference

----
    Please see <<foo>>
----

is mapped to

----
   Please see \ref{foo}
----

Labels can also be constructed
directly in {adl} environments.
Consider the source text below.

----
[env.theorem#pythagoras]
--
Let $a$ an $b$ denote the
altitue and base of a right
triangle.  Let $c$ denote
its hypotenuse.  Then
$c^2= a + b$.
--
----

The code `#pythagoras` creates
a label `pythagoras`.


=== Hyperlinks

The hyperlink

----
    http://nytimes.com[All the news that is fit to print]
----

is mapped to

----
   \href{http://nytimes.com}{All the news that is fit to print}
----

=== Line breaks

The source text

----
Roses are red, +
Daisies are white, +
But all need the light.
----

is mapped to

----
Roses are red, \\
Daisies are white, \\
But all need the light.
----

=== Images

Images can be rendered in both the
HTML produced by {adlp} and in the
PDF files generated by {tex}. Typical
source text for including an image
in an `.adoc` file is

----
image::foo.png[width=200]
----

This is rendered in {tex}
as follows.

----
\begin{figure}[h]{}
\includegraphics[width=2.0truein]{foo.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}
----

In both {tex} and {adl}, the default is
to keep all images in the directory `images`
ad the root of your document directory.


=== Listing

The source text

----
[listing]
....
sum = 0
k = 1
100.times do
  sum += 1.0/k
  k += 1
end
puts sum
....
----

is mapped to

----
\begin{verbatim}
sum = 0
k = 1
100.times do
  sum += 1.0/k
  k += 1
end
puts sum
\end{verbatim}
----

=== Open blocks

Here is an open block:

----
--
This is an anonymous
open block.


End of story.
--
----

It is rendered as-is in LaTeX:

----
This is an anonymous
open block.


End of story.
----

Here is an open block masquerading
as a listing block:

----
[listing]
--
This is an anonymous
open block masquerading
a listing block.

End of story.
--
----

And here is how it is rendered
in LaTeX:

----
\begin{verbatim}
This is an anonymous
open block masquerading
a listing block.

End of story.
\end{verbatim
----


=== Literal

The text

----
[literal]
This
  is
    a test of
      whether
    it realy
  works!
----

is rendered as

----
\begin{verbatim}
This
  is
    a test of
      whether
    it realy
  works!
\end{verbatim}
----

Note that in the source
text there are no blank
lines.  If there are blank
lines, there is an alternate
construction:

----
....
This
  is also

    a test of
      whether

    it realy
  works!
....
----

It is rendered as

----
\begin{verbatim}
This
  is also

    a test of
      whether

    it realy
  works!
\end{verbatim}
----

=== Page break

The text

----
  Fee, fie

  <<<

  fo, fum!
----

will render in TeX las

----
  Fee, fie

  \vfill\eject

  fo, fum!
----

=== Pass

The source text

----
pass:[<<<] is normally a page break.
But now it isn't.
----

is rendered as

----
<<< is normally a page break.
But now it isn’t.
----

NOTE: More attention needed here



== Design of the Asciidoctor-LaTeX processor

{adlp} adds new behavior to the
existing Html5Converter for {adp}.  It does
this via Ruby 2.0's `prepend` method:

[code, Ruby]
----
class Asciidoctor::Converter::Html5Converter
  # inject our custom code into the
  # existing Html5Converter class
  prepend Asciidoctor::LaTeX::Html5ConverterExtensions
end
----

This code ensures that methods of module
`Asciidoctor::LaTeX:Html5ConverterExtensions` are executed
in preference to methods  of module
`Asciidoctor::LaTeX:`.

The new behavior itself is defined
in the module
`Asciidoctor::LaTeX:Html5ConverterExtensions`.
There we find, for example, a new method,
`environment(node)` which handles a new
type of block, the _environment block._
One also finds the method `inline_anchor(node)`,
which already exists in
`Asciidoctor::LaTeX:Html5Converter` and which
processes inline anchors such as

----
  http://asciidoctor.org[Asciidoctor]
----

=== Outline

At its highest level, `module Asciidoctor::LaTeX`
has two components, `module Html5ConverterExtensions`
and `class Converter`.  Let us examine these
in ever greater detail.

[code, ruby]
----

module Asciidoctor::LaTeX

  module Html5ConverterExtensions
  end

  class Converter
  end

end
----

=== module Html5ConverterExtensions

The `Html5ConverterExtensions` module
contains handlers for nodes, e.g, the
`environment_block` node, which is new,
and the `inline_anchor` node, which
has new behavior.

[code, ruby]
----

module Asciidoctor::LaTeX
  module Html5ConverterExtensions
    #
    # Node handlers ...
    #
  end
end
----

==== Html5ConverterExtensions in more detail

[code, ruby]
----
module Html5ConverterExtensions

  def environment node

      attrs = node.attributes

      case attrs['role']
        when 'equation'
          handle_equation(node)
        when 'equationalign'
          handle_equation_align(node)
        ###### etc ######
      end

      node.attributes['roles'] = (node.roles + ['environment']) * ' '
      self.open node
    end

  def click node
    node.lines = [ENV_CSS] + node.lines + [DIV_END]
    node.attributes['roles'] = (node.roles + ['click']) * ' '
    self.open node
  end

  def handle_equation(node)
  end

  ###### etc ######

end
----

==== A typical node handler

[code, ruby]
----
def handle_equation(node)
  options = node.attributes['options']
  node.title = nil
  number_part = '<td style="text-align:right">' + "(#{node.caption}) </td>"
  number_part = ["+++ #{number_part} +++"]
  equation_part = ['+++<td style="width:100%";>+++'] + ['\\['] + node.lines + ['\\]'] + ['+++</td>+++']
  table_style='style="width:100%; border-collapse:collapse;border:0"  class="zero" '
  row_style='style="border-collapse: collapse; border:0; font-size: 12pt; "'
  if options['numbered']
    node.lines =  ["+++<table #{table_style}><tr #{row_style}>+++"] + equation_part + number_part + [TABLE_ROW_END]
  else
    node.lines =  ["+++<table #{table_style}><tr #{row_style}>+++"] + equation_part + [TABLE_ROW_END]
  end
end
----


=== class Converter

In the `Converter` class, preprocessors,
postprocessors, etc., are registered, the backend
is initialized, and converter method is defined.
{adlp} calls the converter on AST (abstract syntax
tree) that the parser has produced, and proceeds
to walk through it node by node.  The converter
dispatches each node to its processor. The handler
is determined by the node, e.g., by its name
 and role.  In so doing, the converter looks in
 an array of node types to
 see if it knows about that kind of node. If
 it does, the node is dispatched to its processor.
 If it does not, it issues a warning which can be used
 to add the needed behavior to the converter.


[code, ruby]
----

class Converter

  include Asciidoctor::Converter

  # Register processors ...

  # def initialize backend, opts ...

  # def convert node, transform = nil ...

end

----


==== Registration
