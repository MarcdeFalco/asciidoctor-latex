This is a common problem and it is the first thing I check when I’m having a javascript problem (I actually do step 1 and 2 with my style.css as well). After checking that the file path is correct, I double check by viewing the page source using Firefox, I then click on the .js link. If it opens up the jQuery file (Double check it is opening the correct file) then the destination is correct. If it does not, or it opens a page-not-found, then I know I have a problem with my file path.
