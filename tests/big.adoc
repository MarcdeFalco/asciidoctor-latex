== Introduction

We begin with quick review of algebraic geometry: affine and projective
varieties, some facts about their topology, their structure as complex
manifolds, and two versions of the de Rham theorem: the classical
one, with differential forms, and the Cech-de Rham version, which
is a purely algebraic construction.  We then take up the study of Riemann
surfaces, with special emphasis on elliptic curves ...

== Basic Algebraic Geometry

Algebraic geometry is vast subject, one whose mastery is complicated by the use
of at least two mathematical languages -- the classical language, and the language
of schemes.  The subject draws on algebraic topology, the theory of manifolds, 
commutative algebra, and -- for Hodge theory -- differential geometry and the 
theory of elliptic partial differential operators.  It is not possible to master
all of this material in a short period of time.  The approach of these notes
is to introduce basic notions with a large set of examples and problem
and just enough theory for the whole to make some sense.  By working
through the problems and discussing them in class, it is hoped that
the student will gain a real appreciation and understanding of the subject
that will serve as a useful introduction to later, more in-depth studies.

Let $ \CC^n $ denote complex $ n $-space with coordinates 
$ (z_1, \ldots, z_n) $, 
let $ f(z_1, \ldots, z_n) $  be a polynomial of degree $ d $ with complex
coefficients,  and let $ X $ be the set of solutions to the equation
$ f(z) = 0 $.  Such a set  an _affine algebraic hypersurface_
of degree $ d $  --
a special kind _affine algebraic set_.  A general affine
variety is the set of common zeroes of an arbitrary collection of polynomials.
By two deep theorems in commutative algebra (the Hilbert Nullstellensatz
and the fact that polynomial rings are 
Noetherian)footnote:[A _Noetherian ring_ is one in which
every increasing chain of ideals $ I_1 \subset I_2 \subset \cdots $ becomes constant after a finite
number of steps.  That is, there no genuinely infinite chains of
ideals.] we know that a finite number
of polynomials is sufficient to define any algebraic variety.

==== Examples

Let us look at examples.  The set
defined by $ z_1 + \cdots + z_n = 0 $  in $ \CC^n $ is an affine
algebraic variety of degree one.  It is isomorphic to $ \CC^{n-1} $.
The set defined by $ z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2 =1 $ is an affine
algebraic variety of degree two, a so-called _smooth quadric_
of dimension $ n-1 $. By _smooth_, we mean that a neighborhood of any
point can be identified with the neighborhood of a point in $ \CC^n $
by a suitable homeomorphism.  Indeed, projection onto a coordinate
hyperplane $ z_i = 0 $ will work, as it does for the sphere $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1 $
in $ \RR^3 $, as pictured below.

FIGURE. 


The set $ X $ defined by $ z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2 = 0 $ is a 
_quadric  cone_.   By _cone_ we mean that there is a point $ O $
in $ X $ such that if $ P $ is in $ X $, then so is the line $ OP $.
This special point is called the _vertex_.
In the case at hand, $ O $ is the origin.
It is also a _singular point_ of $ X $.  Near $ O $, $ X $ is
different than it is near other point. 
(Try to formulate a definition that distinguishes "ordinary" or "smooth"
points from points that are "singular".  The notions 
of smooth and singular are discussed below, but do give this a try now.)

_In how many points does a line $ L \subset \CC^n $ meet
a hypersurface of $ X $ of degree $ d $?_  Is this notion 
completely well formulated?
--

.Comment
--
To make the notion of number of intersection points precise,
consider a parameterization $ t \mapsto \ell(t) $ of a line $ L $.
Let $ f(z) = 0 $ be the equation of $ X $.  The composition
$ f(\ell(t) $ is a polynomial function of one variable.  Its degree
is a measure of the number of points of intersection.
-- 
[env.problem]
--
_Consider the variety $ X \subset \CC^n $ defined by the equations
$ z_1 + \cdots + z_n = 0 $ and $ z_1^2 + \cdots + z_n^2 =1 $ .
Is it non-empty?  What is its dimension?  Can one define a 
notion of degree for it?_
--

[env.problem]
--
_Consider the affine cone $ X $ defined by the equation $ z^2 + w^2 = 0 $ in $ \CC^2 $.  Let $ S^3(r) $ be
the sphere of radius $ r $ centered at the origin  Describe the intersection $ X \cap S^3(r) $.
Is it independent of the radius, up to homeomorphism?  Let $ X' $ be the variety defined
by $ z = 0 $  Compare $ X \cap S^3(\epsilon) $ to $ X' \cap S^3(\epsilon) $._
--

For another class of examples, consider the polynomial equation $ f(z,w) = 0 $,
where $ f $ has degree $ d $.   The solution set $ X $ is a _plane algebraic curve_.  If $ d =1 $, the solution set is isomorphic
to $ \CC $.  If $ d = 2 $, there are two cases, the _smooth conics_
and the _singular conics_.  As an example of the former,
consider the equation   $ f(z,w) =z^2 +(w-1)^2 - 1 $.
Fix a point of $ X $, say $ A = (0,0) $.  Given $ P \in X $, let $ L $
be the line joining $ A $ to $ P $, and note that $ L $ meets $ X $ _only_
in $ A $ and $ P $.  Let $ \Pi $ be the line tangent to $ X $ at $ B = (0,2) $,
and let $ Q $ be the intersection of $ L $ and $ \Pi $.  As  $ P $ approaches $ A $, 
the point $ Q $ approaches infinity.  Let $ \bar \Pi $ be the _Riemann sphere_ --
the one-point compactification of the complex line:
+++\[     
  S^2 = \bar \Pi = \Pi \cup \set{\infty}.
   \]+++



Then the map 
$ P \mapsto Q $ is a homeomorphism 
of $ X $ with its image in $ \bar \Pi $,  It turns out the image is 
consists of the Riemann sphere minus two points.  Thus 
$ X \cong \CC^* $.

[env.problem]
--
_Verify the details of the argument of the homeomorphism 
$ X  \map \bar\Pi $
and show that that homeomorphism is algebraic.._
--

[env.problem]
--
Define the *multiplicity* of a point $ P $ on a plane algebraic curve  
$ X $ given by $ f(z,w) = 0 $, as follows.  Let $ \lambda(t) $
be a parametric curve such that  $ \lambda(0) = P $.  Let 
$ m(P,X) = \min_\lambda \ord_0\, f(\lambda(t) $, where 
$ \ord_0(g(t)) $ is the order of vanishing of $ g(t) $ at zero. (a) What
are the possible multiplicities of points on a conic? (b)  What
are the mutliplicities of the points of the conic $ z^2 - w^2 = 1 $? (c)
What are the multipliciites of the points of $ z^2 - w^2 = 0 $? (d)
If $ X $ is a conic with a point of multiplicity two, what can you say 
about its geometry? 
--


Consider next the plane curve $ C $ with equation
$ z^3 + w^3 = 1 $. It is an example of
a so-called  _affine elliptic curve_. These play an especially important role in the development
of algebraic geometry and also number theory,  e.g., Andrew Wiles' 
proof of Fermat's last theorem.   Because $ C $ is of degree three, the
line-drawing argument given earlier does not a apply to conclude 
that $ C $ is isomorphic to a punctured Riemann sphere.   Nonetheless,
there is information that we can extract from the line-drawing
construction. Let $ A $ be any point of $ C $, and let $ \Pi $ be a line not
containing $ A $.  The line $ L = AP $ generally intersects $ C $ in 
two additional points,  $ P $ and $ P' $.  Map these to $ Q = L\cap \bar \Pi $.  The
result is a 2-to-1 map of $ C $ to $ \bar \Pi $.  If the line $ L $ is tangent
to $ C $ at $ P $, the the map is 1-to-1 at $ P $.  The  point $ P $ is a 
point of _ramification_ of the map.  We call its image
in $ \Pi $ a _branch point_.  *Conclusion:* _the cubic curve
$ z^3 + w^3 = 1 $ is a 2-to-1 branched cover of an open set in $ \bar \Pi $._

[env.problem]
--
In the example above of a 2-to-1 projection of a cubic
curve, how many ramification points are there?
--

Here is another way of constructing a 2-to-1 branched cover.  Let $ g(z) $
be a polynomial of degree $ d $, and consider the affine algebraic curve $ X $
with equation $ w^2 = g(z) $.  Consider the projection of $ \CC^2 $ 
onto the $ z $-axis.  This map induces a map
$ X \map \CC $ which is of degree two: the inverse image of a "generic" point
consist of two distinct points, namely, the square roots of $ f(z) $.  When
$ f(z) = 0 $, the inverse image consists of a single point.   The  _branch locus_.
is th eset of roots of $ f $.

When $ g(z) $ is of degree three or four,  the affine curve $ w^2 = g(z) $
is an elliptic curve. The line-drawing construction still applies, except that
the point $ A $ is the point at infinity, and so the lines drawn are vertical.
Nonetheless, the construction applies.

[env.problem]
--
_Use the branched cover description of an affine elliptic curve
to compute its Euler characteristic.  Then (a) generalize your result
to the case $ w^2 = f(z) $ where $ f(z) $ where $ f(z) $ has no
multiple roots.
Consider also the case in which the polynomial $ f(z) $ has 
one double root._
--

==== Smooth and singular points

Consider once again a general hypersurface $ X $,
the variety  defined by a single equation.  
If the gradient of $ f $
is nonzero at a point $ a $ of $ X $,  then (by the holomorphic implicit
function theorem),  there is a neighborhood
$ U $ of $ a $ in $ X $ and a parametrization 
$ v: V \map U \subset X $ where (a) $ V $ is a neighborhood
in $ \CC^{n-1} $, (b) $ v $ is a homeomorphism of $ V $ and $ U $.
After a suitable re-ordering of coordinates, the map $ v $ has the 
form
+++\[   
   v(z_1 \commadots z_n) = (z_1 \commadots z_{n-1}, 
         g(z_1 \commadots z_{n-1}).
   \]+++
That is, $ v $ is given by the graph of the map $ g $.  The function $ g $
is the solution of the equation
+++\[   
  f(z_1 \commadots z_n, g(z_1 \commadots z_n)) = 0,
   \]+++
and that solution is what is guaranteed by the implicit function theorem.



Let $ u: U \map V $ be the inverse function. Then  (c),
$ \nabla u(b) \ne 0 $ for all $ b \in U' $.  The components $ u_i $ of $ u $
are called  _local coordinates_ on $ U $.  We say that the points of $ U $ are _smooth_.
If all points of $ X $ are smooth, we say that $ X $ is smooth. This is synonymous
with being a manifold.   

If all derivatives of $ f $ vanish at $ a $, then there exist
no local coordinates, and the point in question is said to be _singular_.  The origin in 
$ \CC^2 $ is  a singular point of the hypersurfaces $ xy = 0 $, $ y^2 =  x^2 + x^3 = 0 $,
and $ y^2 = x^3 $.  These singularities have names: the first two are _nodes_,
and the last is a _cusp_.



There is, by the way, no mystery about how local coordinates are constructed.
If $ a $ is a point of $ X $, then there is an $ i $ such that $ \partial f/\partial z_i(a) \ne 0 $.
Consider the projection "deletion of the $ i $-th coordinate",
+++\[   
  p_i: \CC^n \map \CC^{n-1},
   \]+++
given by
+++\[   
   p_i(z_1, \ldots, z_n) = (z_1,\ldots,z_{i-1},z_{i+1},\ldots z_n),
   \]+++
where $ p_1(z) = (z_2, \ldots, z_n) $ and $ p_n(z) = (z_1, \ldots, z_{n-1}) $.
There is a small neighboorhood $ U $ of $ a $ such that $ p_i $ is  
a homeomorphism of $ U $ onto its image $ V $. The restriction
of $ p_{i}^{-1} $ to a $ V' $ is the sought-after local coordinate.
Local coordinates can always be constructed in this way, namely,
as the inverses of projections.

==== Tangent space and tangent cone

Let $ a \in X $ be a smooth point of a hypersurface. The orthogonal
complement to $ \nabla f(a) $ in the space of vectors based at
$ a $ is by definition the _tangent space_ of $ X $ at $ a $.  
There is a more general definition which goes as follows.  Given
$ a \in X $, consider parametric lines $ \ell(t) = a + bt $.  Consider the
composition $ f(\ell(t)) $.  Let $ a_dt^d $ be the term in the power
series of $ f(\ell(t)) $ of least degree such that $ a_d \ne 0 $.  For all
$ b $, we have $ d \ge  1 $.  However, for certain lines, $ d = 2 $.  We may think of these as the limits of secant lines, where the limit is
taken as two of the ponts tend to $ a $.  The set of vectors $ b $ based at $ a $ for which $ d \ge 2 $ is called the _tangent cone_
of $ X $ at $ a $.  If $ a $ is a smooth point, the tangent cone is a vector 
space, namely, orthogonal complement of $ \nabla f(a) $.  In general 
we may define the _Zariski tangent space_ as the span of the 
tangent cone.

[env.problem]
--
Consider the surface $ S \subset \CC^3 $ defined by
 $ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t(x^3 + y^3 + z^3) = 0 $
(a) Show that for all values of $ t $, $ S $ is smooth except
at the origin. (a) What is the multiplicity of the origin in $ S $?
(b) What is the tangent cone of $ S $ at the origin? (c) What is
the tangent cone at other points of $ S $?
--

==== Manifold Structure

Consider a hypersurface $ X \subset \CC^{n+1} $ 
with equation $ f = 0 $.  Suppose that  the 
gradient vector is nonzero at every point of $ X $. Then every
point of $ X $  has a neighborhod $ U $ and a chart 
+++\[   
  \phi_U: U \map \CC^n.
   \]+++
A set of charts whose domains $ U $ cover a given topological
space is called an _atlas_.

If $ U \cap V \ne \emptyset $, we can form the composed function
+++\[   
   \phi_{UV} = \phi_U\circ \phi_V^{-1}.
   \]+++
The composition maps a domain (open set) in $ \CC^{n-1} $ to
another domain in $ \CC^{n-1} $.  These are called the _transition
functions_ .  Transition functions relate one chart to another on 
overlaps:
+++\[   
   \phi_U = \phi_{UV} \circ \phi_V.
   \]+++

In the case of hypersurfaces
defined by polynomial, or even holomorphic functions, the 
transition functions are holomorphic.

The transition functions obey the _cocycle conditions_
+++\[   
  \phi_{VU} = \phi_{UV}^{-1}
   \]+++
and
+++\[   
  \phi_{UW} = \phi_{UV}\phi_{VW}
   \]+++
These conditions ensure that one can construct a manifold by 
"gluing."  Let $ \set {(U, \phi_U)} $ be a collection of sets and 
functions such that the transition functions (abstractily defined
by $ \phi_U = \phi_{UV} \circ \phi_V $) satisfy the cocycle conidtions.
Consider the disjoint union $ \UUU $ of the sets $ U $.  Define a
a relation by saying that $ a \sim b $ if $ \phi_{VU}(a) = b $, where
$ a \in U, b \in V $.  The cocycle conditions imply that this relation
is reflexive and transitive, that is, it is an equivalence relation.
Let $ X $ be the qutoient of $ \UUU $ by $ \sim $.  It is a manifold.

[env.definition]
--
A _differentiable  manifold_ of dimension $ n $ is 
a topologicial space  endowed with an atlas
of charts $ \sett{\phi_U}{\phi_U: U \map \RR^n} $
whose whose transition functions
are differentiable ($ C^\infty $).  
A _complex manifold_ of dimension $ n $
is a topological space endowed with 
an atlas of charts $ \sett{ \phi_U }{\phi_U \map \CC^n} $ 
whose transition functions
are holomorphic.

==== Double Covers

Consider  the algebraic curve $ X $ with equation 
$ w^2 = f(z) $, where $ f(z) $
has distinct roots. The gradient of the defining
equation $ g(z,w) = w^2 - f(z) $ is $ (f'(z), 2w) $.
If $ w = 0 $, then $ f(z) = 0 $.  But a root $ a $ of $ f $ is a simple root,
so $ f'(a) \ne 0 $.  Thus the gradient of $ g $ is nowhere zero on $ X $,
and so  $ X $ is a complex manifold.  

It is nonetheless useful to find charts on $ X $.  There will be two kinds.  If $ P = (z,w) $ is a point of $ X $ and $ f(z) \ne 0 $, then we 
claim that $ z $ is a local coordinate.  In this case 
$ \nabla g = (f'(z),2w) $ with $ w \ne 0 $.  Then projection of the 
tangent space onto the $ z $-axis is isomorphism, and so 
$ z $ gives a local coordinate.

If $ p = (z,w) $ is a point of $ X $ and $ f(z) = 0 $ then $ w = 0 $
and $ \nabla g = (f'(z), 0) $.  But $ z $ is not a multiple root of $ f $,
so $ f'(z) \ne 0 $.  Now projection onto the $ w $-axis is an
isomorphism on tangent spaces and so is an isomorphism
locally.


===== The Riemann Sphere

The Riemann Sphere $ \bar \Pi $, which we encountered
as the one-point compactificaitn of the complex line $ \CC $, carries the structure of a complex manifold.  Define a cover by two open sets $ U $ and $ V $, where $ U = \CC $ and where 
$ V = \CC - \set{0} \cup \set{\infty} $.  Let $ u $ be the natural coordinate on $ U = \CC $.  Let $ v: \CC - \set{0} \map \CC $ 
the the function $ v = 1/u $.  As $ u $ tends to $ \infty $, $ v $
tends to zero, and one finds that it is a homeomorphism
between $ V $ and $ \CC $. The transition function is
+++\[   
   g_{VU}(u) = 1/u.
   \]+++
This is a holomorphic automorphism of $ \CC^* $.  Thus $ \Pi $
is a 1-dimensional complex manifold.


===== Double covers of the Riemann sphere

Let $ w^2 = f(z) $ define a double cover $ X $ of $ \CC $.  We
are going to define a double cover $ \bar X $ of the 
Riemann sphere $ \bar\Pi $ whose restriction to $ \CC $ is
the given cover.  Consider first the case
in which $ f $ has even degree $ 2d $, and let $ u = 1/z $ define the 
transition functions for the standard cover of $ \Pi $ by open
sets $ U $ and $ V $.  The given double cover should be thought
of as a double cover $ X_U $ of $ U $.

In the $ (u,w) $ coordinate system we have
+++\[   
  w^2 = \frac{g(u)}{u^{2d}},
   \]+++
where $ g(u) $ is a polynomial of degree $ 2d $ with $ g(0) \ne 0 $.
Let $ v = wu^d $.  Then $ (v,u) $ is also a coordinate system,
since we can solve for $ (z,w) $ in terms of $ (v,u) $.  The equation
for $ X $ over $ U \cap V \cong \CC^* $ is 
+++\[   
  v^2 = g(u).
   \]+++
This relation defines a cover $ X_V $ of $ V $. The Riemann sphere
is 
+++\[   
   \bar\Pi = U \cup V,
   \]+++
and the relation
+++\[   
  \bar X = X_U \cup X_V.
   \]+++
defines a double cover of $ \bar \Pi $.

The Riemann sphere is a compacitification of the complex line
+++\[   
    \bar\Pi = \CC \cup \set{\infty} \cong S^2
   \]+++
which in addition to being a topological space, has the structure
of a complex manifold.  There various ways to compactify
afine $ n $-space, but of these, one stands out: complex 
projective $ n $-space, $ \CP^n $, which has the property of
being a complex manifold of dimension $ n $.

[env.definition]
--
Complex projective $ n $-space, written $ \CP^n $, is the 
space of lines through the origin in $ \CC^{n+1} $.
--

To understand wha we mean by _space_ of lines, observe that
a  line though the origin in $ \CC^{n+1} $ is given by a 
nonzero vector $ Z $.  If $ Z' $  is nonzero scalar multiple
of $ Z $, then it  defines the same lines as does $ Z $..
Introduce the equivalence relation  $ Z' \sim Z $
if and only if $ Z = \lambda Z $ for some $ \lambda \in \CC - \set{0} $.
Then $ \CP^n $ is the set of equivalance
classes $ [Z] $ in $ \CC^{n+1} - \set {0}  $.  
As a topologicial space, it carries the quotient topology. 

==== The tautological and Hopf bundles

Projective space may also be viewed as the quotient under
a group action.  Consider a space $ Y $ and a group $ G $.  An 
action of $ G $ on $ Y $ is a map $ G\times Y \map Y $,
written $ (g,y) \mapsto g.y $, that satisfies $ e.y = y $ for all
$ y $, where $ e $ is the neutral element, and $ g.(h.y) = (gh).y $
for all $ g,h \in G $, $ y \in Y $.  The _orbit_ of point $ y \in Y $
under the action of $ G $ is the set $ G.y = \sett{g.y}{ g \in G} $.
The quotient of $ Y $ by $ G $, written $ Y/G $, is the set of orbits.
Note that $ Y/G $ is just the set of equivalence classes of elements
of $ Y $ under the relation $ y' \sim y $ if there is an element $ g \in G $
such that $ y'  = g.y $.

Returning to the construction of projective space,
the map 
$ (\lambda, Z) \mapsto \lambda Z $
defines an
action of the group $ \CC^* $ on 
$ \CC^{n+1} - \set{0} $, and 
+++\[   
   \CP^n = (\CC^{n+1} - \set{0})\big/\CC^*
   \]+++
is the quotient. If $ p: \CC^{n+1} - \set{0} \map \CP^n $
is the projection map, then the set 
+++\[   
  p^{-1}([Z]) = \set{ Z \in [Z]} \cong \CC^*,
   \]+++
the so-called
_fiber_ of $ p $ at $ [Z] $ can be identified with $ \CC^* $.
This leads to the important diagram 
+++\[   
   \CC^* \map \CC^{n+1} - \set{0} \mapright{p} \CP^n,
   \]+++
which defines a $ \CC^* $ bundle over $ \CP^n $ called the 
_tautological bundle_.  
It plays a key role in the theory of projective varieties.

FIG

Consider now the  unit sphere
+++\[   
  S^{2n+1} = \sett{ Z \in \CC^{n+1} } { ||Z|| = 1 }.
   \]+++
It is stable under the action of unit circle subgroup
+++\[   
  U = \sett{ \lambda \in \CC}{ |\lambda| = 1 }.
   \]+++
The natural map 
+++\[   
  S^{2n+1} \map \CC^{n+1} - \set{0}
   \]+++ 
restricts ot a map of quotient spaces
+++\[   
   S^{2n+1}/U \map (\CC^{n+1} - \set{0})/\CC^*,
   \]+++
and it is easy to see that this map is an isomorphism.
This gives a second presentation of projective space
as the quotient of a sphere, and it leads to the famous
_Hopf fibration_,
+++\[   
    S^1 \map S^{2n+1} \mapright{h} \CP^n.
   \]+++
The Hopf map is, by the way, the generator of the homotopy
group $ \pi_3(S^2) $.

==== Manifold structure

As noted above, a point $ [Z] $ in $ \CP^n $ is an equivalence class of vectors 
$ Z' \in \CC^{n+1} - \set{0} $ under the relation $ Z' \sim \lambda Z $,
where $ \lambda \ne 0 $.  Any one these $ Z $'s, including $ Z $ 
itself, is said to be a _homogeneous coordinate vector_ of the
point $ [Z] $.  Consider the set 
+++\[   
  U_i = \sett{ [Z] \in \CP^n }{ Z_i \ne 0}
   \]+++
If the condition $ Z_i \ne 0 $ holds for any $ Z \in [Z] $,
it holds for all $ Z \in [Z] $.  Thus $ U_i $ is a well-defined
subset of projective space.  Since it is defined by
the negation of an equation, it is an open set.  These
sets cover projective space, and constitute its _standard cover_.
(Why do they cover $ \CP^n $?)



The open sets $ U_i $ are biholomorphic to $ \CC^n $ via the map
that sends a homogeneous coordinate vector to the vector
of ratios $ Z_j/Z_i $ for $ j \ne i $.  The ratios are _affine
coordinates_ on the $ U_i $.

[env.problem]
--
Describe the transition functions for $ \CP^1 $ and 
$ \CP^2 $  relative to the standard cover.
--

.Solution
--
(a) For $ \CP^1 $ we have homogeneous coordinates $ Z = [Z_0,Z_1] $.
On $ U_0 $, the local coordinate function is
$ \phi_{U_0}([Z_0,1Z_1]) = Z_1/Z_0 $.  On 
 $ U_1 $, the local coordinate function is
$ \phi_{U_1}([Z_0,1Z_1]) = Z_0/Z_1 $.
Then
$ \phi_{U_1U_0}( Z_1/Z_0) = \phi_{U_1}([Z_0,Z_1]) = Z_0/Z_1 $.
In other words, $ \phi_{U_1U_0}(u) = 1/u $.

(b) For $ \CP^2 $ we proceed in the manner.  
+++\[   
  \phi_{U_0}([Z_0,Z_1,Z_2]) = (Z_1/Z_0, Z_2/Z_0)
   \]+++
and
+++\[   
  \phi_{U_1}([Z_0,Z_1,Z_2]) = (Z_0/Z_1, Z_2/Z_1)
   \]+++
Then
+++\[   
\phi_{U_1U_0}(Z_1/Z_0, Z_2/Z_0) =
   (Z_0/Z_1, Z_2/Z_1) = ( (Z_0/Z_1)^{-1},   (Z_2/Z_0)(Z_0/Z_1)^{-1}),
   \]+++
so that 
+++\[   
   \phi_{U_1U_0}(u,v)  = (1/u, v/u).
   \]+++
--



==== Cell decomposition

Consider now the complement of $ U_i $ in $ \CP^n $.  This is
the closed set $ Z_i $, which we can identify with $ \CP^{n-1} $.
Thus we have the decompostion
+++\[   
  \CP^n \cong \CC^n \cup \CP^{n-1}
   \]+++
into disjoint  sets, one open and one closed. When $ n = 1 $, this decomposition
is 
+++\[   
  \CP^1 \cong \CC \cup \set{\text{point}}.
   \]+++
Consequently, $ \CP^1 $ is the same as the one point compactification of $ \RR^2 $.  Using stereographic projection, we identify this compactificaton as the  two-sphere, $ S^2 $, and we call the
point the "point at infinity".  By analogy, in the decomposition
$ \CP^2 = \CC^2 \cup \CP^1 $, we call $ \CP^1 $
the "line at infinity".


.



One can use the above description to present $ \CP^n $
in another way.  Let $ e^n  = \sett{ x \in \RR^n }{ ||x|| \le 1 } $
the the $ n $-disk, and let  $ S^{n-1} = \sett{ x \in \RR^n }{ ||x|| = 1 } $
be its boundary.  Then $ \CP^1 $ can be identified with the space
+++\[   
  e^2 \cup_h \set{a},
   \]+++
where $ \set{a} $ is a one-point  set , and where $ h: S^1 \map \set{a} $ is the "collapsing map", 
that is, the constant map.  This is a special
case of the construction 
+++\[   
   A \cup_h B,
   \]+++
where $ h: C \map B $ is a map from a subset $ C $ of $ A $.  It is
the quotient of the disjoint union of $ A $ and $ B $ by the relation
that declares $ a $ and $ h(a) $ to be equivalent.  That is, we glue
$ A $ to $ B $ along $ C $ using $ h $.

We have asserted the existence of an isomorphism 
+++\[   
   e^2 \cup_h \set{a} \map \CP^1,
   \]+++
but we have not exhibited the map defiining it.
Let us do so in general, for
+++\[   
  e^{2n} \cup_h \CP^{n-1} \map \CP^n 
  = \CC^n \cup \CP^{n-1}
   \]+++
where $ h $ is the Hopf map.  Identifying $ \RR^{2n} $ with 
$ \CC^n $,  consider the map
+++\[    
   f(z) = \left[ 1, \frac{z}{1 - ||z||} \right]
   \]+++
for $ ||z|| < 1 $.  This map is a homeomorphism between
the interior of the unit $ 2n $-cell $ e^{2n} $ and 
the set $ U_0 \cong \CC^{n} $ in $ \CP^n $.  On the boundary
of the $ 2n $-cell, map $ z $ to its equivalence class $ [z] $ in 
$ \CP^{n-1} $.  Finally, map the
$ \CP^{n-1} $ on the left to the $ \CP^{n-1} $ on
the right by the identity.  

At this point we have the required map on the level of sets.
There are, however, things to check in order to have a
 homeomorphism, foremost being continuity.  Note that
for vectors with $  0 < ||z|| < 1 $, we have
+++\[   
  f(z) = \left[ 1 - ||z||, z \right] 
  =  \left[ \frac{1 - ||z||}{||z||},  \frac{z}{||z||} \right],
   \]+++
so that 
+++\[   
   \lim_{||z||\to 1} f(z) = [0, z] = h(z).
   \]+++
This is the statement needed to establish continuity.  With it,
we have a description of $ \CP^n $ as a $ CW $ complex:

[env.theorem]
--
Complex projective $ n $ space has a cell decomposition 
with one $ 2i $-cell $ e_{2i} $ for each $ i $ in 
$ \set{0, 1 \commadots n} $.
The cell $ e_{2i} $ is attached to the $ (2i-1) $-skeleton via the 
Hopf map.
--

We have not given a formal definition of a cell complex, although
there are enough hints in our description of $ \CP^n $ to imagine
such a definition.  Let's give it ia try.  A cell-complex consists
of a series of skeleta $ X_n $, where $ X_0 $ is a collection of points
(0-cells), and $ X_n $ is obtained from $ X_{n-1} $ by attaching
 a collection of $ n $-cells $ e^n_\alpha $.  By "attaching", we
mean that there are maps 
+++\[   
  h_\alpha: \partial e^n_\alpha \map X_{n-1}
   \]+++
and that $ X_n $ is the quotient of the disjoint union of $ X_{n-1} $
and the $ e^n_\alpha $ by the relations imposed by the $ h_\alpha $.

If the highest dimension of a cell of $ X $ is $ n $, we say that $ X $
is an $ n $-dimensional cell complex.  As a further example, take the 
$ n $-sphere.  It is obtained by attaching an $ n $-cell to a point, and
so has one cell of dimension zero and one cell  of dimension $ n $.
It is another way of describing the one-point compactification of 
$ \RR^n $.

==== Homology

_This section is best read with a certain familiarity with homology theory.
For a full  and excellent, treatment see 
http://www.math.cornell.edu/~hatcher/[Hatcher].  Nonetheless,
we give a sketch of the theory.
this http://www.noteshare.io/lessons/841[section]._

There are various ways to compute the homology of 
a space $ X $ -- singular or simplicial, for example.  Singular homology
is the gold standard because it is functorial by construction.
Simplicial homology is geometric and intuitive.  But another
way is to use _cellular chains_.  This is an efficient yet still
geometric way  of computing homology if the space under consideration has
the structure of a regular cell complex.  We first review the purely
algebraic notion of a chain complex and its homology.

==== Abstract chain complexes and homology


The homology groups are computed from an underlying object called
a _chain complex_. A chain complex is a graded group
+++\[   
   C_\bullet = \oplus_k C_k
   \]+++
endowed with operators
+++\[   
   \partial: C_k \map C_{k-1}
   \]+++
where $   \partial^2 = 0  $.  The operator $ \partial $ is called
the _boundary operator_.  Define the groups
+++\[   
   Z_k = \sett{ a \in C_k }{ \partial a = 0 } = \set{ \text{k-cycles} }
   \]+++
and 
+++\[   
     B_k = \sett{ a \in C_k }{ a =  \partial b \ \text{for some}\ b }
   = \set{ \text{k-boundaries}}
   \]+++
Because of the relation $ \partial^2 = 0 $, $ B_k \subset Z_k $,
and so we can form the quotient group
+++\[   
  H_k = \frac{Z_k}{B_k}.
   \]+++
This is the $ k $-th homology group of the complex $ C_\bullet $.

[env.example]
--
Consider the complex
+++\[   
  C_\bullet= [C_1 \mapright{\partial} C_0] = [\ZZ \mapright{n} \ZZ] 
   \]+++
where the map is multiplication by $ n $.  When $ n = 0 $, $ H_k = \ZZ $
for $ z \in \set{0,1} $.  This is really shorthand for
+++\[   
  C_\bullet= 
[ \cdots \mapright{0} 0 \mapright{0} 0 \mapright{0}\ZZ
 \mapright{n} \ZZ]
   \]+++

When $ n \ne 0 $, $ H_k = 0 $ for $ k> 0 $, and $ H_0 = \ZZ/n $.
--


The case $ n = 0 $ may seem trivial (it is), but it is also important.  If all
the boundary of a complex are zero, we say that it is _harmonic_.  In that
case, one has $ H_\bullet \cong C_\bullet $.


[env.example]
--
Consider the complex
+++\[   
  C_\bullet= [C_2 \mapright{\partial} C_1 \mapright{\partial} C_0] 
 = [\ZZ \mapright{\partial}\ZZ^2 \mapright{\partial} \ZZ] 
   \]+++
where the first boundary operator is the diagonal, $ \partial(a) = (a,a) $,
and where the second is difference, $ \partial(x,y)  = x - y $.
Then $ \partial^2 = 0 $.  One finds that $ H_k = 0 $ for all $ k \ge 0 $.
--

==== Homology of cell complexes

We now consider topological spaces $ X $ with the underlying structure
of a cell complex.  Using that "cellular structure" we define 
a chain complex and homology groups.  It is true, but beyond
the scope of these brief notes, that the resulting homology groups
are independent of the cellular structure used to define them.

Consider first the unit interval $ [0,1] $.  It is
a cell complex with two 0-cells (points), the sets $ \set{0} $ and $ {1} $,
and a single $ 1 $-cell $ [0,1] $, which consider to be oriented
from by arrow with base at $ \set{0} $ and head at $ \set{1} $.
Let $ C_\bullet $ be the $ \ZZ $-module generated by these cells,
where the degree of the cell is the dimension the underlying object,
that is, $ [0,1] $ has degree 1 and the $ \set{i} $ have degree $ 0 $.
Thus $ C_1 = \ZZ[0,1] $ and $ C_0 = \ZZ\set{0} \oplus \ZZ\set{1} $.
Define a boundary operator by
+++\[   
  \partial [0,1] = \set{1} - \set{0}.
   \]+++
Note that we use the sens of the arrow to determine the sign of
the coefficients of the boundary operator.  Let us call this 
the _complex of simplicial chains_ on $ [0,1] $, written 
$ C_\bullet([0,1]) $.

[env.problem]
--
What is homology of $ C_\bullet([0,1])] $?
--

[env.problem]
--
Consider the real line with the cell structure given by 0-cells
$ \set{i} $ for any integer $ i $, and 1-cells $ [i, i + 1] $.  Let 
$ C_\bullet(\RR) $ be the graded group with tese cells as generators.
What is the homology of the complex $ C_\bullet(\RR) $?
--

[env.problem]
--
Consider the cell decompostion of the circle $ S^1 $ with 1-cells $ [a,b] $,
$ [b,c] $, and $ [c,a] $, zero-cells $ \set{a} $, $ \set{b} $, $ \set{c} $, 
and boundary operator such that 
+++\[   
  \partial[\text{left},  \text{right}] = 
  \set{\text{right}} - \set{\text{left}}.
   \]+++
Compute the homology of $ S^1 $.
--

FIG

At this point there is a fork in the road.  The one-dimensional
examples just considered are both simplicial complexes and cell
complexes.  In dimension two and higher, the notions diverge.
Consider, for example, the 2-sphere, which is homeomorphic to the
surface of a tetrahedron.  Viewing it this way gives it the structure
of a simplicial complex -- a triangulated object with four 2-simplices,
six 1-simplices, and four 0-simplices.  We can also view the 2-sphere as
 a cell complex with one 2-cell attached along its boundary to a 0-cell.
We take the latter route, as it gives an especially powerful and also
geometric way of computing homology.  

In simplicial homology, there
is a generator of the chain complex for every simplex, whlle for a cell
complex it is one generator per cell: the chain complex as a graded group
 the sum
+++\[   
   C_\bullet  = \oplus_{e: \text{cells}} \ZZ e.
   \]+++
The sum is 
It  is graded  by the dimension of the cells, so that
+++\[   
   C_k(X) = \oplus_{\dim e = k} \ZZ e.
   \]+++
These groups are related by boundary maps
+++\[   
  \partial: C_k \map C_{k-1}
   \]+++
which we describe in a moment, and it turns out that 
$ \partial^2 = 0 $, so that the $ C_k $ form a complex, and a homology
theory is defined.

Let us now define the boundary map on a cell $ e^k_\alpha $.
Its boundary sphere is attached to the $ (k-1) $-skeleton
by a map $ h: S^{k-1}_\alpha \map X_{k-1} $.  Let 
$ c: X_{k-1} \map X_{k-1}/X_{k-2} $ be the map that
crushes the $ (k-2) $-skeleton to a point.  The target is a bouquet
of $ (k-1) $-spheres, that is, a collection of spheres attached at one
point, the collapsed $ (k-2) $-skeleton.  Thus we have
+++\[   
  X_{k-1}/X_{k-2} = \cup_\beta S^{k-1}_\beta
   \]+++
and maps
+++\[   
  h_{\alpha\beta}: S^{k-1}_\alpha  \map S^{k-1}_\beta
   \]+++
obtained by following the attaching map by the map the crushes
all but one sphere to a point.  A map $ f $ between spheres of the
same dimension has a _degree_ -- an integer which measures
how many times the domain sphere wraps around the range sphere.
Let  $ d_{\alpha\beta} $ be the degree of $ h_{\alpha\beta} $, and set
+++\[   
    \partial e^k_\alpha = \sum_{\beta} d_{\alpha\beta}e^{k-1}_\beta.
   \]+++
This is the boundary map for cellular homology. There is still work
to be done, of course, e.g, show that $ \partial^2 = 0 $.

We come now to a remarkable property of cellular homology.
In some cases the cell structure is so simple, that the boundary 
operator is identically zero. In that case $ Z_k = C_k $ and $ B_k = 0 $,
so that $ C_k = H_k $.  In other words, each cell is an inpendent
homology generator!  In such cases, we call the chain 
complex _harmonic_.

[env.example]
--
The chains for the standard cell structure of the sphere (all dimensions)
are harmonic.  Thus $ H_k(S^n) \cong \ZZ  $ for $ k \in \set{0,n} $,
and $ H_k(S^n) = 0 $ otherwise.
--

[env.example]
--
There are no chains of odd degree for the standard cell structure
of $ \CP^n $.  Therefore the chains are harmonic, and 
$ H^{k}(\CP^n) \cong \ZZ $ for $ k \in \set{0, 2 \commadots 2n} $
and $ H^k(\CP^n) = 0 $ otherwise.
--

==== Functoriality and fundamental class

Let $ f: X \map Y $ be a continuous map of topological spaces.
Assume that both have the structure of cell complexes.  We say
that $ f $ is _cellular_ if for all $ k $ it maps the $ k $-skeleton of $ X $
to the $ k $ skeleton of $ Y $.  Most continuous maps are not cellular.
However,  any continuous map is homotopic, i.e., can be deformed
to a cellular map.  Cellular maps induce maps on homology, since
$ k $-cells map to linear combinations of $ k $-cells -- the coefficients
are degrees, as in the definition of the boundary map.

////
Todo: discuss the degree of a map.
////

[env.example]
--
Consider the map $ f: S^1 \map S^1 $ defined on the unit circle
in the complex plane by $ f(z) = z^n $.  Give $ S^1 $ the structure
of a cell complex with one 1-cell $ e_1 $ and one 0-cell $ e_0 $.
Then $ f(e_1) = ne_1 $. The map on 1-chains is multiplication by 
$ n $, as is the map on first homology.
--

[env.example]
--
Let $ X $ be a cell complex  of dimension $ n $ with just $ n $-cell $ e^n $.
If $ \partial e^n = 0 $, then $ e^n $ generates $ H_n(X) $, and 
$ H_n(X) \cong \ZZ $.  We call the homology class of $ e^n $ the
_fundamental homology class_, and we write it as $ [X] $.  This terminology
applies whenever $ H_n(X) \cong \ZZ $.
--

[env.example]
--
Let $ X $ be a cell complex,  let $ Y $ be an orientable manifold 
of dimension $ k $, and let $ f: Y \map X $ be a continuous function.  Then
+++\[   
   f_*[Y] \in H_k(X)
   \]+++
defines a homology class which we may think of as given by the
image of the top cell in $ Y $.  If $ f $ is an inclusion map, we 
write $ [Y] \in H_k(X) $.
--

[env.remark]
--
If $ X $ is an orientable manifold, it is homotpic to a cell complex 
with a single $ n $-cell.  That $ n $-cell represents the fundamental 
class.
--
[env.remark]
--
Let $ f: X \map Y $ be a map of smooth manifolds of the same
dimension $ n $.  A _critical point_
of $ f $ is point $ a \in X $ where $ f'(a) $ has rank less than $ n $.
A _critical value_ is a point $ b \in Y $ which is the image
of a critical point.  A theorem of Sard states that the set of critical
values has measure zero.  A point in $ Y $ is _regular_ if it is not
critical.  Suppose that $ X $ and $ Y $ are both oriented.  One way
of defining an orientation is to choose a _volume form_: a nowwhere
vanishing differential form $ \Omega $ of degree $ n $.  Suppose $ a $
a regular (non-critical point) of $ f $, and that $ b  = f(a) $.  We say that
$ f $ is _orientation preserving_ at $ a $ if $ (f^*\Omega_Y/\Omega_X)(a) $
is a positive number.  If it is negative, we say that $ f $ reverses
orientations at $ a $.  Let $ \deg_a f = +1 $ in the first case, set
$ \deg_a f = -1 $ in the second.  Define the degree of $ f $ by
+++\[   
   \deg f = \sum_{a \in f^{-1}(b)} \deg_a f
   \]+++
This is the degree of the map.
--

[env.problem]
--
Let $ f: S^1 \map S^1 $ be the map defined by $ f(z) = z^n $, where
$ S^1 $ is the set of complex numbers of absolute value 1.  Use
$ d\theta $ as the volume form and compute the degree of $ f $.  Verify 
all details. Compare your answer to the integral
+++\[   
    \int_{S^1} f^* d\theta
   \]+++
Finally, investigate the question: are there self-maps 
of the circle of negative degree?
--

[env.problem]
--
Define a map $ f: \RR^2 \map \RR^2 $ by setting $ f(z) = z^n $, where
we make the identification $ \RR^2 \cong \CC $ of the Euclidean
plane with the complex numbers.  Show that this map extends to 
a smooth map $ f: S^2 \map  S^2  $ of the Riemann sphere.  Find the
degree of $ f $.  Compare it to the integral
+++\[   
  \sqrt{-1}\int_\CC f^* dz \wedge d\bar z.
   \]+++
Finally, investigate the question: are there self-maps 
of the Riemann sphere of negative degree?
--

[env.problem]
--
In the previous two problems we are in the context $ f: X \map X $
where $ X $ is an oriented manifold.  Thus $ f_*[X] = n[X] $
for some integer $ n $.  What is the relation of that integer
to the degree?
--

==== Chow ring

There is yet a another way of constructing the homology 
of $ \CP^n $.  Let $ L $ and $ L' $ be a linear subspace of codimension
$ i $ and $ j $ respectively. That is, $ Li $ is the subset of 
$ \CP^n $ defined by the 
vanishing of $ i $ independent homogeneous linear forms,
and $ L' $ defined by $ j $ forms which are independent with 
respect ot each other and also with respect to the forms
of $ L $.
We may, for example, take $ L $ to be defined by $ Z_0  = 0 $,
$ L'' $ to be defined by $ Z_1 = 0 an Z_2 =0 $.  Note that
$ L \cong \CP^{n-i} $.  With the choices made,
+++\[   
  L \cap L'= L'',
   \]+++
where $ L'' $ has codimension equal to the sum of the 
codimensions of $ L $ and $ L' $.   Define the _Chow ring_ of $ \CP^n $  
to be the graded ring with components
+++\[   
   Ch^k (\CP^n) = \sett{nL^k}{n \in \ZZ},
   \]+++
where 
$ L^k $ has codimension $ k $.  The ring structure is then given 
by 
+++\[   
   mL^i \cdot nL^j = mn L^{i+j}
   \]+++
One must in fact be more careful thatn we have been 
during this dicussion.  There a many choices of linear
subspaces of codimension $ i $, but we choose to 
ignore this fact ad view them as essentially the same.
To do this precisely we use the notion of linear equivalence
described in the next section.  


We can also grade the Chow ring by dimension instead of codimension.  Then
+++\[   
   Ch_k(\CP^n) = \ZZ L_k,
   \]+++
where $ L_k $ is linear space of _dimension_ $ k $.
If we do this, then we have the following result:

[env.theorem]
--
There is an isomorphism of graded modules
+++\[   
   H_\bullet(\CP^n) \map Ch_\bullet(\CP^n)
   \]+++
that sends the class of $ e_{2k} $ to the class of $ L_k $.

Just as affine $ n $-space is the natural home for
affine algebraic sets, projective $ n $-space is the 
home for a natural category, the _projective algebraic
sets_.  These are closed subsets of $ \CP^n $ whose 
intersection with an affine open set $ U_i $ is an affine
variety.  Thus a projective variety $ X $ is constructed
by glueing affine varieties $ X_i = X \cap U_i $ together
along common parts $ X_{ij} = X_i \cap X_j $.
If the pieces $ X_i $ are complex manifolds, then so is
$ X $.  

A projecitive variety can also be defined "directly"
as the set of common zeroes of a set of _homogeneous_
polynomials.  On the face of it, a homogeneous polynomial
$ F(Z_0 \commadots Z_n) $  defines an algebaic set in 
$ \CC^{n+1} $.  However, because it is homogeneous,
the group $ \CC^* $ acts on it to produce a quotient.
Let $ a $ be a point of $ \CC^{n+1} $, and let 
+++\[   
  \CC^*a= \sett{\lambda a}{\lambda \in \CC^*}
   \]+++
be the _orbit_ of $ a $ under the group action.  If $ a \ne 0 $,
then the orbit is isomorphic to $ \CC^* $.  If $ a = 0 $, then
the orbit is the origin.  Notice that the origin is in the closure
of ever nonzero orbit.  As a result the quotient space
has a strange topology.  Points corresponding to nonzero
vectors are not closed, and the closure of such a point consists
of the given point plus the origin.  The origin itself is dense:
its closure is the entire space!  You now have in front of 
you a naturally occurring example of one of those pathological
spaces studied in a first course on general topology.


Because of the foregoing pathology, we consider the quotient
in $ \CC^{n+1} - \set{0} $ of a collection of polynomials.  The
quotient space is Hausdorff, and is a closed subspace of the 
projective space studied previously. Let us  look at examples.


==== Hypersurfaces

Consider a single homogeneous polynomial $ F(Z) $
of degree $ d $.  Its zero-set $ \tilde X $ in $ \CC^{n+1} - \set{0} $ is invariant under the $ \CC^* $ action and so defines a closed subset $ X \subset \CP^n $ as discussed above.  To identify 
the affine sets $ X_i  = X \cap U_i $, recall that  
the sets $ U_i $ are identified with $ \CC^n $ via the map
which sends $ (Z_0 \commadots Z_n) $
to $ (Z_0 \commadots Z_{i-1}, 1, Z_{i+1} \commadots Z_n) $.
This is because the equivalnece class of a vector $ Z $
with $ Z_i \ne 0 $ has a unique representative with $ Z_i = 1 $.
Via this identification, $ X_i $ is mapped to the affine
hypersurface with equation 
+++\[   
  F(Z_0 \commadots Z_{i-1}, 1, Z_{i+1} \commadots Z_n) = 0.
   \]+++
As an example, consider the surface in $ \CP^3 $ with equation
$ Z_0^3 + Z_1^3 + Z_2^3  + Z_3^3  = 0 $.  Its equation in 
$ U_0 \cong \set{ Z_0 = 1} $ is $ F(1,Z_1,Z_2,Z_3) = 0 $, 
or just
+++\[   
  1 + Z_1^3 + Z_2^3 + Z_3^3 = 0.
   \]+++
The origin is the only zero of the gradient of the 
function  $ F(1,Z_1,Z_2,Z_3) $.  Since the origin is not a point of $ X_0 = U_0 \cap X $, we
conclude that $ X_0 $ is smooth.   By symmetry, all the $ X_i $
are smooth,  Thus $ X $ is a smooth projective hypersurface.

Let $ F $ be homogeneous.  Show that

==== Topology of hypersurfaces

In the last chapter we found a cell decomposition of projective
space, and from that decomposition we found the homology of
projective space.  We now investigate the homology of hypersurfaces.
The main technical result is the following.

[env.theorem]
--
Let $ X \subset \CP^{n+1} $ be a projective hypersurface.  Then 
$ \CP^{n+1} $
is homotopic to a space obtained from $ X $ by attaching cells  
of dimension $ n+1 $ and greater.
--
The assertion of interest is the following consequence:

[env.corollary]
--
Let $ i: X \map \CP^{n+1} $ be the inclusion of a hyperuface in its
ambient space.  Then
+++\[   
  i_*: H_i(X) \map H_i(\CP^n)
   \]+++
is an isomorphism for $ i < n $ and is a surjection for $ i = n $.
--
Note that $ H_n(X) $ is the _middle_ homology group.  The result
says that below the middle dimension, the homology of a hypersurface
is the same as the homology of projective space.  In the middle dimension,
the homology is at least as big as projective space.  By Poincar duality,
the homology of the hypersurface is the same as 
that of projective space, modulo torsion.

===== Morse theory

The key to proving the main technical result is _Morse theory_.
It provides a way of constructing cell decompositions from
information about the critical points of a function on a manifold.
Let us illustrate this by two examples, then give a general result.
Consider first a sphere of unit diameter resting on a plane as 
in the figure below.  Let $ h(x) $ be the function which measures
the height of a point $ x $ above this plane.  The critical values
of $ h $, viewed as a function on the sphere $ X $, are 0 and 1.
Let $ X_a = \sett{ x \in X}{ h(x) \le a } $ be the _level set_ 
of level $ a $
Thus $ X_0 $ is a  point, the "South Pole",  and $ X_1 = S^2 $ is the 
sphere itself.  For $ 0 < a  < 1 $, $ X_a $ is homeomorphic
to a 2-cell $ e^2 $   Only at critical values of the height function
does the topology of the level set change.




For any level $ a $, consider the set of points 
+++\[   
  X_a(\epsilon) = \sett{x \in X}{ |h(x) - h(a)| \le \epsilon }
   \]+++
whose height differs from that of $ a $ by at most $ \epsilon $.  In our case,
+++\[   
   X = X_{0.5} \cup X_{1.0}(0.5)
   \]+++
This is just the decomposition into southern and northern hemispheres.
But notice that after a homotopy, we can write this as
+++\[   
   X = \set{\text{South Pole}} \cup_f e^2
   \]+++
where we attach the boundary of $ e^2 $ (the equator) to the south pole
by the collapsing map.  _From the height function, one deduces the 
cell decomposition._  

.The Torus
Consider  the torus, as in the next figure. We arrange it
so that the crtical values of the height function $ h $ are 0, 1, 2, 
and 3,.  The first thing we notice is that, as before, the topology
of the level set changes only at critical values of the height
function.  Indeed, we can make the following observations:

.  For $ X_0 $ is a 0-cell.  For $ a \in (0,1) $, $ X_a $ 
is a 2-cell.

.  The set $ X_{1 + \epsilon} $ is 
homotopic to $ X_{1 - \epsilon} $ with a 1-cell attached
to its boundary. 

. The set $ X_{2 + \epsilon} $ is 
homotopic to $ X_{2 - \epsilon} $ with a 1-cell attached
to its boundary. 

. The set $ X_{3} $ is 
homotopic to $ X_{3 - \epsilon} $ with a 2-cell attached
to its boundary. 

FIG

To summarize, each critical point corresponds attaching a cell.
These critcal points correspond to the critical values
0, 1, 2, 3, and for them we adjoin a cells of dimension 0, 1, 1, and 2.
The critical value 0 is a local minimum.  It corresponds to a 
0-cell.  The critical value 3 is a local maximum and corresponds
to attaching a 2-cell.  The critical values 1 and 2 are saddle points
and correspond to attaching a 1-cell.

.The General Case
These observations furnish the key to understanding what happens
in general.   In general a "nondegenerate" critical  point with criical 
value $ c $ will be a kind
of gneraliizd saddle with $ i $ downward-pointing directions
and $ n-i $ upward pointing directions.  The set 
$ X_{c + \epsilon} $
is obtained from $ X_{c-\epsilon} $ by attaching an $ i $-cell.

Let us try to formulate this more precisely.
Define  a _Morse function_
+++\[   
  h: X \map \RR,
   \]+++
where $ X $ a smooth real manifold of dimension $ n $,
to be a smooth function whose
critical points are _non-degenerate_   By this we meant 
that if  $ a $ ia a point where the gradient of $ h $ is zero, then 
the Hessian matrix
+++\[   
    H(a) = \left(\frac{\partial^2 h}{\partial x_i \partial x_j}(a)\right)
   \]+++
is of maximal rank.  Here the $ x_i $ are local coordinates on $ X $.
 If $ a $ is a non-degenerate critical point, the 
$ H(a) $ has $ i $ negative eigenvalues and $ j = n - i $ positive eigenvalues.
The number $ i $ is the _Morse index_ of the critical point. 
At a critical point of Morse index $ i $, there are local coordinates
$ x_1 \commadots x_n $ such that 
+++\[   
   h(x_1 \commadots x_n ) = -(x_1^2 + \cdots + x_i^2)
    \\ + (x_{i+1}^2  + \commadots + x_n^2) 
   \]+++
Consider the gradient vector field $ \nabla h $ near the critical point.
It defines a _flow_ -- a family of diffeomeorphisms $ \phi_t $.  If 
$ b $ is a point of $ M $, the $ \phi_t(b) $ is the point obtained by 
releasing the point $ b $ and letting it move for $ t $ seconds
according to the velocity field $ \nabla h $.  The points $ b $ near
$ a $ for which 
+++\[   
   \lim_{t \to \infty} \phi_t(b) = a
   \]+++
constitute the _stable manifold_ of the gradient flow near $ a $.  If
$ h(x,y) = -x^2 + y^2 $, then we are at a saddle point.  If $ y = 0 $,
then $ \nabla h $  is proportional to $ (-1,0) $, and so the flow
moves points along the $ x $ axis towards the origin.  The 
stable manifold is the $ x $-axis.  In the general case, the
stable manifold is given by the the $ (x_1 \commadots x_i) $-axis.

[env.theorem]

If $ h $ is a Morse function with a critical point of index $ i $, then
$ X_{c + \epsilon} $ is obtained from $ X_{c - \epsilon} $  by attaching
the stable manifold times a small $ (n-i) $-disk.
--


[env.theorem]

Let $ X \subset \CP^{n+1} $ be a projective hypersurface and
let $ U $ be  tubular neighborhood of $ X $.  There is a Morse 
function $ h: \CP^{n+1} - U \map \RR $ all of whose critical
points have index $ i \ge n+1 $.

==== General algebraic sets


A projective algebraic set is the set of common zeros of 
a collection of homogeneous polynomials.  Again by commutative
algebra, a finite subset of the set of defining polynomials is 
sufficient.  If a projective algebraic set can be written as the union
of projective algebraic sets, it is said to be _reducible_.  An example
is the set $ Z_1Z_2 = 0 $ in $ \CP^2 $ which consists of two
distinct projective lines meeting at the point $ [1,0,0] $. A projective
variety which is not reducible is said to be _irreducible_.  An example is the quadric $ Z_0^2 + Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 = 0 $.  It is smooth, and this forces it to be irreducible (why?).  

An irreducible algebraic set is also called a _variety_.  Every 
algebraic set is a finite union of varieties.  A variety may be smooth,
as is the quadric of the previous paragraph, or it may have
singularities, as does the cone in $ \CP^2 $ defined
by  $ Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 = 0 $.  (Note the absence of the variable
$ Z_0 $).  
The vertex of the cone, $ [1,0,0] $, is a singular point, and all other points are smooth.  At smooth points  one has local coordinates,
and so the notion of dimension is defined.  We define the dimension
of a variety to be the dimension at a smooth point. 

[env.problem]
--
Let $ X \subset \CP^2 $ be the quadric cone 
with equation  $ Z_1^2 + Z_2^2 = 0 $.  Describe the affine
set $ X_0 = U_0 \cap X $.  Describe the set $ X_0' = X - X_0 $.
--


.Comment
--
The above discussion begs two questions: (a) Does a variety have
any smooth points? (b) Is the dimension independent of the 
smooth point taken? Regarding (a), a variety may have no smooth points if
it is _nonreduced_.  A correct treatment of this notion passes
through the theory of schemes, but one can say this now.  
If $ G $ is irreducible and $ F = G^k $, then $ F = 0 $ is a non-reduced
variety (of multiplicity $ k $). This is basically the only way a variety can fail to have
smooth points.  By passing to the associated reduced variety, which in this case if $ G = 0 $,
we find smooth points.  Regarding (b), the codimension of the
singular set of a variety is at least one.  For complex varieties,
this means that the real codimension of the singular set is
at least two.  Therefore the complement of the singular set is
connected.  This is sufficient to prove that the dimension
is independent of the smooth point chosen.  In the real case
it could be otherwise.  Note that the complement of a point in 
$ \RR^2 $ is connected, but the compement  of a line is not.
--


We define
the _codimension_ to be the dimension of the ambient projective
space minus the dimension of the variety.  The conics considered
have dimension one and codimension one.  Consider the 
quadric $ Z_0^2 + ... + Z_n^2 = 0 $ in $ \CP^n $.  It has dimesion
$ n-1 $ and codimension $ 1 $.  Consider its intersection $ X $ with the 
quadric cone $ Z_1^2 + 2Z_2^2 + 3Z_3^2 + \cdots + nZ_n^2 = 0 $.
Then $ X $ has dimension $ n-2 $ and codimension $ 2 $.

==== Families of varieties and degenerations

Let $ F $ and $ G $ be homogeneous forms of degree $ d $, for example, $ F = Z_0Z_1Z_2 $ and 
$ G = Z_0^3 + Z_1^3 + Z_2^3 $.  Consider the polynomial
$ H(t,Z) = F + tG $.  We may view it as defining an algebraic
subset $ X $ of $ \CC\times\CP^2 $.  Let $ p $ and $ q $ be
the projections of $ \CC\times\CP^2 $ onto $ \CC $ 
and $ \CP^2 $, respectively, and use the same letters
for the restrictions of these projections to $ X $.  Then
we have have a map 
+++\[   
  p: X \map \CC
   \]+++
whose fibers $ X_t $ satisfy
+++\[   
 qp^{-1}(t) = \sett{[Z]}{ F(Z) + tG(Z) = 0}.
   \]+++
Thus $ X_t $ is a plane curve of degree three, with $ X_0 $ the union  of three lines in general position.  The fiber
 $ X_t $, except for possibly finitely many values of $ t $,
is a smooth plane cubic.  

The family just constructed is an example of a _degeneration_.
The generic fiber is smooth, whereas the special fiber is singular,
indeed, singular of a very special form.  We can use this very special form to deduce properties of the general fiber.  In the 
case at hand, $ X_0 $ is a union of three spheres arranged as in the figure below.  The spheres meet at double points, and near the 
double points the family is given in suitable analytic coordinates
by the equation $ xy = t $.

FIGURE

Consider $ X_t $ near a double point for  $ t $ very small.  The fiber
looks locally like a hyperboloid of revolution.  As $ t $ tends to 
zero, the fiber tends to a pair of disks (topologically) joined at a point.  

FIGURE

The result of "regenerating" from $ X_0 $ to $ X_t $ can be 
described as follows.  Cut out a neighboorhood of the node.
The boundary of the neighborhood thus cut out is a pair of disjoint
circles.  Glue a cylinder to the cut-out object, pasting the top circle
of the cylinder to one of the given circles, the bottom circle of the 
cylinder to the other.  The process can be pictured as in the
figure below

FIGURE


Now consider the effect of doing preceding construction at all the
nodes.  The result is illustrated below.

FIGURE

We conclude that $ X_t $, for $ t $ general is
topologically a torus.

$ d $ using degeneration-regeneration.

[env.problem]
--
In the example above, can we make sense of $ X_\infty $, 
the fiber at infinity?  Can we write down its equation?
--


==== Algebraic cycles

Let $ \set{Z_i} $ be a collection of algebraic subvarieties.
A linear combination $ c_1Z_1 + \cdots + c_nZ_n $
with coefficients in $ \ZZ $, $ \QQ $, etc., is called an
_algebraic cycle_.   In the example $ F + tG = 0 $ above,
$ X_0 $ defines an algebraic cycle $ L_1 + L_2 + L_3 $, namely the 
sum of its components (with multiplicities, which happen to be
equal to 1).  The general fiber $ X_t $ also defines a cycle,
namely a smooth plane cubic.  We say that these cycles
are _linearly equivalent_, and we write
+++\[     
   X_0 \sim X_t
   \]+++
where in this context $ X_0 $ and $ X_t $ denote the 
cycle of the fiber, not the fiber itself.

[env.theorem]
--
Algebraic cycles which are linearly equivalent are homologous
--

.Proof
--
Let $ \gamma:[0,1] \map \CC $ be a path joining 0 to $ t $.
Then $ p^{-1}\gamma[0,1] $ can be triangulated to a chain
whose boundary is $ [X_1] - [X_0] $.
--

One needs to extend the notion of linear equivalence from 
those defined by hypersurfaces to the arbitrary case.  Once this
is done, one defines the Chow groups:
+++\[   
    Ch_k(X) 
    = \frac{ \text{algebraic cycles of dimension k } } {\text{linear equivalence}}
   \]+++
By the theorem above, there is a map
+++\[   
  Ch_k(X) \map H_{2k}(X)
   \]+++
This map is in general neither injective nor surjective, though it
is in important special cases.  A great deal of algebraic geometry,
both classical and modern,
is  devoted to understanding this map better.


==== Bezout's theorem


In it simplest form, Bezout's theorem states that varieties $ X_1 $,  $ X_2 $ that are of complementary dimension  and 
which are in sufficiently general position meet in $ d_1d_2 $ points, counting multiplicities.  For example,
 a line and a plane cubic curve $ X $ meet in three points counting multipicites.  If the line $ L $ is generic, the intersection is the an
algebaric cycle $ P + Q + R $, where the three points
are distinc.  If the line is tangent to $ X $ at $ P $ then
the intersection cycle takes the form $ 2P + Q $. It thus
has one point of multiplicity two.  We think of it as the limit
of two points of multpilicity one.  Finally, if $ L $ is an inflectional
tangent, then the intersection cycle is $ 3P $ and so consists
of  on point of multipllicity three.

[env.problem]
--
How many points of a cubic curve can be inflectional tangents?
--

Let  return to Bezout's theorem and  decode the statements that  comprise it.  "Complementary dimension"
means that the dimensions add up to the dimension of
the ambient space. A line and a surface have complementary dimensions in $ \CP^3 $, and two surfaces
in $ \CP^4 $ also have complementary dimenson.

To understand "general position", consider the case where $ X_1 $
a union of two distiinct lines $ L $ and $ L' $ and $ X_2 $  is a third line.  
For most choices of $ X_2 $, the variety $ X_1 \cap X_2 $ consists
of a pair on points.  These are "simple" intersections, each of multiplicity one.  But if $ X_2 $ passes through the point $ P = L \cap L' $ then $ P $ is a point of intersection of multiplicity two.  Think of it as the limit of two simple points of intersection.  There is final, even
more exceptional case.  $ X_2 $ coould coincide with one of the 
lines $ L $, $ L' $ wiich make up $ X_1 $.  In that case the dimension 
of the intersetion is one, not zero.  But for most choices of $ X_2 $,
that is, a general choice, this does not happen.

The degree of a hypersurface
is the degree of its defining polynomial.  More generally, the degree
of a variety is the number of points, with multiplicity of the intersection with a linear space of complementary dimension.

.Comment
--
The set of special lines lines, the ones for which the intersection
cycle is nont a sum fo point of multiplicity one, falls into two pieces.
The first is the set of lines through the point $ P $. This set of lines
can be identified with $ \CP^1 $.  Then there are the lines $ L $ and
$ L' $ themselves. These are points of the the $ \CP^1 $.  The right
way to think of the set of special lines is that it is an algebraic set
of dimension one with two "embedded components," namely the 
points corresponding to $ L $ and $ L' $.  There is a fact worth repeating: _the set of speical lines has the structure of an algebraic set_.  

We might ask: what about the set of all lines in $ \CP^2 $?  Well,
a line is given by a linear equation $ a_0Z_0 + a_1Z_1 + a_2Z_2 = 0 $.  Map the line to the homogeneous coordinate vector 
$ [a_0, a_1, a_2] $.  This map is a bijection between the set of
line in $ \CP^2 $ and the set of points in the _dual projective space_
$ \check{\CP}^2 $.  Thus the set of all lines is an algebraic variety
and the set of special lies is a subvariety. The complent of a subvariety is "large: it is open and dense, and its volume
is the same as the volume of the full space. Consequently,
 a line chosen at random will, with probability one, be non-special.

This pheonomeon -- parameter spaces having an algebraic
structure, and special subsets appearing as algebraic subvarieties,
is quite typical.
--
==== A proof of Bezout's theorem.

We will give two proofs of Bezout's theorem for plane curves.
The first is by degeneration.  Let $ A $ and $ B $ be plane
curves of degrees $ a $ and $ b $ respectively.   We place the first in generating family of curves $ A_t $ where $ A_1 = A $ and 
$ A_0 $ is the union of $ a $ distinct lines in general positoin.
We know that a single line meet $ B $ in $ b $ points.  Therefore
$ A_0 $ meets $ B $ in $ ab $ points.  Now regenerate $ A_0 $ and 
follow the points of intersection.  You will see that points of 
intersection are neither created nor destroyed -- they simply
wander around.  (You should try to give a more formal proof; 
nonetheless, this is true, and is one of two key points
in the proof.  We conclude that $ A $ and $ B $ also meet in 
$ ab $ points. _Quod erat demonstrandum._

For the second proof, we make the remark that the interesction 
product of plane curves, which is a zero cycle, is Poincar dual
to the cup product of the Poincar duals of the curves, considered
as homology classes.  The Poincar dual of $ A $ is $ a $ times a generator $ x $ of $ H^2(\CP^2) $.  The Poincar dual of $ B $ is
$ bx $.  Their cup product is $ abx^2 $, or $ ab $ times the fundamental
class of $ \CP^2 $.  And the dual of this class is $ ab $ times a point, 
which is in tun cohomologous to 
"anything".

==== The Chow ring again

Let us expand our definition of the Chow ring of 
projective space.  Define an algebraic cycle of codimension
$ k $ to be any linear combination of classes of 


==== Elliptic curves: the addition law

Let $ X $ be smooth plane cubic curve, and choose coordinates so that its equation is of the form $ w^2 = z^3 + az + b $.  The projective
form of the equation is $ UW^2 = Z^3 + aZU^2 + bU^3 $, and the line at infinity, $ U = 0 $, meets $ X $ in the single point 
+++\[   
  O = [U,Z,W] = [0,0,1].
   \]+++
This point will play a special role in what follows.  Note that lines drawn from $ O $ to points on $ X $ are vertical
with respect to projection onto the $ z $-axis.

By Bezout's theorem,  line a $ L $ intersects $ X $ in three points, counting multiplicity. This fact allows one to define the structure of a group on $ X $.  T.  Given points $ A $ and $ B $, let $ AB $ be the line
joining them, and let $ C $ be the third point in which $ L $ cuts
$ \EEE $.  If $ C = (z,w) $, let $ \iota(C) = (z,-w) $.  Then $ A + B = \iota(C') $ 
defines a composition law.  Commutatiivity is obvious, and one can verify the other group axioms with some work.  Associatiavity
is the most difficult to prove.

Let us verify some of the axioms  For the zero
element choose a flex: a point $ O $ at which the tangent line $ L $ meets the curve with multplicity three.  Because  
$ L\cdot X = 3O $, we have $ O + O = O $.  And because lines $ OA $ are vertical, $ O $,  $ A $, and $ \iota(A) $ are coliinear.  Since $ \iota $
is an involution, $ \iota^2  = 1 $, this proves that $ O + A = A $.
Moreover, $ A + \iota(A) = \iota(O) = O $, and so additive inverses
exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             

==== Topology
As a topological space, an elliptic curve is a torus, as 
depicted in the figure below.  Its homology is generated by the two cycles
$ \delta $ and $ \gamma $.  Thus we have
+++\[   
   H_1(\EEE, \ZZ) \cong \ZZ^2 = \ZZ\set{ \delta, \gamma}.
   \]+++

FIGURE


==== Singular Varieties

Consider an algebraic curve $ M $ given by an equation $ f(z,w) = 0 $.
In the case of our elliptic curve, $ f(z,w) = w^2 - p(z) $.
The  construction of charts or holomorphic parameterizations via
projections onto the axes and their inverses work in a neighborhood
of a point on $ M $, provide that $ \nabla f \ne 0 $ at the point.
This is a consequence of the implicit function theorem.  A point
at which $ \nabla f = 0 $ is called _singular_.  A point at which 
$ \nabla f \ne 0 $ is called _non-singular_, or _smooth_.  If all 
points of $ M $ are smooth, then we say that $ M $ is smooth.  In that
case it is a complex manifold.  

As an example, consider the elliptic curve $ \EEE $
with equation $ x^2 - y^2 + x^3 = 0 $.  The origin is a singular point.  In 
suitable analytic coordinates $ u,v $ in a neighborhood of the origin,
$ \EEE $ is given by the equation
+++\[   
   u^2 - v^2 = 0
   \]+++
Near the origin, $ \EEE $ looks like the union of the lines $ u = v $ and $ u  = -v $.
This kind of singularity is called a _node_.  The other important type 
of singularity for elliptic curves is the _cusp_, with equation $ w^2 = z^3 $.

Both the node and the cusp are singularities of multiplicity two.  To define
multiplicity, consider a polynomial equation $ f(z,w) = 0 $ with $ (0,0) $ as solution.
The 
+++\[   
   f(z,w) = f_m(z,w) + f_{m+1}(z,w) + \cdots,
   \]+++
where the $ f_\ell(z,w) $ are homogeneous polynomials of degree $ \ell \le d $
where $ d $ is the degree of $ f $.  The leading term has degree $ m \ge 1 $, and
that degree is by definition the multiplicity. The variety defined by 
$ f_m(z,w) $ is the _tangent cone_ of $ f = 0 $ at the given point.  
Thus the multiplicity is just the degree of the tangent cone.

To understand the significance
of the tangent cone, consider  a parametric line 
$ \phi(t) =(\lambda t, \mu t) $, and let 
 $ f\circ\phi(t) = f(\lambda t , \mu t) $ be the composition with $ f $.  Then
+++\[   
   f\circ\phi(t) = f_m(\lambda.\mu)t^m + f_{m+1}(\lambda.\mu)t^{m+1} + \cdots
   \]+++
If $ (\lambda. \mu) $ is not a solution of $ f_m(\lambda.\mu) = 0 $, the
$ f\circ\phi(t) $ vanshhes to order $ m $. If $ f_m(\lambda.\mu) = 0 $, then
the composition vanishes to order greater than $ m $.  In other words,
the tangent cone, viewed as a _projective_ variety, is the set of lines
which are "more tangent" to the variety at $ p $ than a generic line through $ p $.

For elliptic curves, the two kinds of tangent cones which appear are those
of the node and cusp, respectively.  The cones are a pair of distinct lines
in the first, and a doubled line in the second.







== Homology and Cohomology 

Homology and cohomology are invariants attached to topological
spaces which detect certain geometric features -- loosely said,
the number of independent $ k $-dimensional holes.   To say
that the homology groups are invariants is to say that 
homeomorphic spaces have 
isomorphic homology groups.  


Since the homology and cohomology of a space are "dual" objects,
we choose one and study the other later.
Let us begin with the homology of a space $ X $. It is
  a _graded abelian group_, $ cX) $ meaning
that it is a direct sum
+++\[   
H_\bullet = \oplus_{k \ge 0} H_k,
   \]+++
where the  $ H_k $ are abelian groups.
For the $ n $-sphere $ S^n $, this group is $ \ZZ $ in degrees $ k = 0 $
and $ k = n $; for all other degrees it is zero.  By contrast, the homology
groups of $ \RR^n $ are zero for all $ n > 0 $.  Because of what was said about
invariance, this means that $ S^n $ is never homeomorphic to $ \RR^n $ for 
$ n > 0 $.
These observations capture 
the fact the the $ n $-sphere is an object built around an $ n $-dimensional
hole; indeed, it is a way of making that notion precise.


In the next section we will discuss several ways to define homology.
For now, we discuss its main properties and show how these properties
can both be used to prove things and to make computations.  One usually
uses the properties, not the construction itself, to compute homology.

Homology and and cohomology are _functorial_, meaning loosely
that they behave well with respect to maps between spaces. If $ f: X \map Y $
is a continuous map then there is an induced map
+++\[   
   f_*: H_k(X) \map H_k(Y)
   \]+++
for all $ k $.   Consider, for example, the unit circle $ S^1 $, which we may view
as the set of complex numbers $ z $ with unit absolute value.  Let $ f: S^1 \map S^1 $
be the map defined by $ f(z) = z^n $.

<<Periods I>> +
<<The Algebraic de Rham Complex II>> +
<<The Fundamental Class of Projective Space>> +

As we have seen in XXX, classical de Rham cohomology is computed
using the complex $ \EEE^\bullet $ of $ \CCC^\infty $ differential forms.
In the first section below, we will see, 
following Grothendieck, how to define the
cohomology of an algebraic variety using a purely algebraic objects,
the _Algebraic de Rham Complex_.  In the second section, we 
verify that the definition works by computing the cohomology 
of $ \PP^1 $.  We will also compare algebraic de Rham and classical
de Rham cohomology.  Via this comparison, we arrive at the abstract
notion of period as used by Grothendieck and Deligne, and we
compute the field of periods for  the punctured
affine line $ \AA^1- \set{0} $ and for the projective line $ \PP^1 $.

==== The Algebraic de Rham Complex I 

Let $ X $ be a smooth affine variety, e.g, $ \CC $ or $ \CC^* $.
Let $ A^p(X) $ be the space of algebraic $ p $-forms on 
$ X $.  If $ X $ is defined over a field $ k $, we may take the $ A^p(X) $
to be defined over $ k $ as well.  The exterior derivative
makes the graded $ k $-vector space 
+++\[   
  A^\bullet = \oplus_k A^k
   \]+++
into a complex.  

.Definition {counter:definition}
[[def:adrcxaffine]]
--
_The algebraic de Rham cohomology of an affine variety $ X $
is the cohomology $ H^\bullet_{DR}(X) $ of $ A^\bullet(X) $._
--

.Example {counter:example}
[[ex:affine_line_DR]]
--
Let $ X = \AA^1_k $ be the affine line over a field $ k $.  Then
$ A^0(X) = k[x] $ is the ring of polynomials in $ x $ with coefficients
in $ k $ and 
+++\[   
  A^1(X) = \sett{ f(x)dx }{ f(x) \in k[x]}.
   \]+++
For $ p > 1 $, 
$ A^p(X) = 0 $.  One sees directly that $ H^0_{DR} = k $ and
that $ H^1_{DR}(X) = 0 $.
--

.Example {counter:example}
[[ex:punctured_affine_line_DR]]
--
Let $ X = \AA^1_k - \set{0} $ be the punctured affine line over a field $ k $.  
Then
+++\[   
  A^0(X) = \Sett{ \frac{f(x)}{x^n} }{ f(x) \in k[x] }
   \]+++
and 
+++\[   
  A^1(X) = \Sett{ \frac{f(x)dx}{x^n} }{ f(x) \in k[x] }
   \]+++
For $ p > 1 $, 
$ A^p(X) = 0 $.  One sees directly that $ H^0_{DR}=  k $ and
that 
+++\[   
  H^1_{DR}(X) = k\Set{\frac{dx}{x}}.
   \]+++
--

====  Comparison Theorem I

Let $ X $ be an algebraic variety defined over a subfield $ k $ of 
the complex numbers.  An algebraic de Rham form is also a smooth, or
$ \CCC^\infty $ de Rham form.  In other words, there is an inclusion of
complexes
+++\[   
  A_{alg}^\bullet \map A_{smooth},
   \]+++
This map of complexes induces a map of cohomology vector spaces,
and we have the following result.

.Theorem {counter:theorem}
[[th:comparison_affine]]
--
_The natural map $ H^\bullet_{alg,DR} \map H^\bullet_{smooth,DR} $ 
is an isomorphism._
--

Recall the classical de Rham theorem:

.Theorem {counter:theorem}
[[th:classical_DR]]
--
_The natural map $ H^\bullet_{smooth,DR} \map H^\bullet_{sing,DR} $ 
is an isomorphism._
--

The map is defined as follows.  Let $ \phi $ be a closed form, and let
$ [\phi] $ be its class in $ H^\bullet_{smooth,DR} $.  Let
+++\[   
  \iota[\phi](\gamma) = \int_\gamma \phi
   \]+++
for all cycles gamma.  This relation associates to a closed form
a linear functional on homology classes, i.e, a cohomology class.
_(Exercise: prove that this map is well-defined.)_  Thus we have 
a map
+++\[   
  \iota: H^\bullet_{smooth,DR} \map H^\bullet_{sing}.
   \]+++
de Rham's theorem states that this map is an isomorphism.


==== Periods I

Recall that $ H^p_{DR}(X,k) $ is a $ k $-vector space.  Identifying 
$ H^p_{DR}(X,k) $ with its image in $ H^p_{sing}(X,\CC) $, we
have
+++\[   
  H^p_{DR}(X,k) \otimes_k \CC = H^p_{sing}(X,\CC).
   \]+++
In other words, the algebraic de Rham cohomology defines a $ k $-structure
on the complex vector space $ H^p_{sing} $.  There is another $ k $-structure 
defined by the inclusion 
+++\[   
  H^p_{sing}(X,k)  \map H^p_{sing}(X,\CC).
   \]+++
   
To compare the two structures, let $ \phi_1, \ldots \phi_n $ be
a basis for $ H^p_{DR}(X,k) $, let $ \gamma_1, \ldots, \gamma_n $
be a basis for $ H_p(X,k) $, and let $ \gamma_1^*, \ldots, \gamma_n^* $
be the dual basis.  Write
+++\[   
  \phi_i = \sum_j P_{ij}\gamma_j^*.
   \]+++
The matrix $ P = (P_{ij}) $ is the _period matrix_.  Note that
+++\[   
    P_{ij}  = \int_{\gamma_j} \phi_i,
   \]+++
justifying the terminology.

.Example {counter:example}
[[ex:periods_cstar]]
--
For the punctured affine line, the algebraic de Rham cohomology
is generated by $ dz/z $ and the homology is generated by the path
$ \theta \mapsto \exp(2\pi i\theta) $ which parameterizes the unit
circle $ |z|  = 1 $.  Up to multiplication by a scalar in $ k $, there 
is "just one" period, namely,
+++\[   
  P  = \int_{|z| = 1} \frac{dz}{z} = 2\pi\sqrt{-1}.
   \]+++
--

The example just given leads us to the notion of the _field of periods_.
This is the $ k $-vector space generated by the $ P_{ij} $.  In the
case of the punctured affine line with $ k \ \QQ $, we have
+++\[   
  K_{per}(H^1(\AA^1 - \set{0}) = \QQ(2\pi\sqrt{-1}).
   \]+++

A fundamental invariant of such a field is its transcendence degree.

.Theorem {counter:theorem}
[[th:transcendence_punctured_affine_line]]
--
_The transcendent degree of the field of periods of the punctured
affine line is 1._

==== The Algebraic de Rham Complex II

To this end, fix an
algebraic variety $ X $ and an cover $ \UUU $ by Zariski open sets $ U_i $.
Let $ I = (i_1, \ldots , i_p) $ be a multi-index of degree $ p $ and let
$ U_I  = U_{i_1} \cap \cdots \cap U_{i_p} $.  Let $ \Omega^q(U_I) $
be the space of algebraic $ q $-forms on $ U_I $, and let
+++\[   
    C^p(\UUU, \Omega^q) = \oplus_{|I|=p+1} \Omega^q(U_I),
   \]+++
where the sum is taken over all $ (p+1) $-fold intersections.
This is the space of Cech-deRham cochains of bidegree $ (p,q) $.

The exterior derivative defines an operator
+++\[   
  d: C^p(\UUU, \Omega^q)  \map C^p(\UUU, \Omega^{q+1}) 
   \]+++
It satisfies $ d^2 = 0 $ and is of type $ (0,1) $ in the sense that its
sends an object of type $ (p,q) $ to one of type $ (p,q+1) $.  Recall
that the Cech coboundary is an operator defined by the alternating
sum of restriction maps.  Consider, for example an element
$ \phi \in C^1(\UUU, \Omega^q) $.  Write $ \phi_{ij} $ for the 
component of $ \phi $ defined on $ U_i \cap U_j $.  For an element
$ \psi \in C^2(\UUU, \Omega^q) $.  Write $ \psi_{ijk} $ for the 
component of $ \psi $ defined on $ U_i \cap U_j \cap U_k $.
Then the relation 
+++\[   
   ( \delta \phi )_{ijk} =   \phi_{jk} -  \phi_{ik} +  \phi_{ij}
   \]+++
defines an element $ \delta \phi \in  C^2(\UUU, \Omega^q) $.  
_(Exercise:  give the general definition of $ \delta $.)_

The operator 
+++\[   
  \delta: C^p(\UUU, \Omega^q) \map C^{p+1}(\UUU, \Omega^q)
   \]+++
is the _Cech coboundary_.  It satisfies $ \delta^2 = 0 $, is of type $ (1,0) $, 
and also commutes with exterior differentiation:  $ \delta d = d\delta  $.

Now consider the operator $ D = d + (-1)p $ on $ C^p(\UUU,\Omega^q) $.
It is also of square zero (_Exercise_).  
Let 
+++\[   
   A^k =  \oplus_{p+q=k} C^p (\UUU, \Omega^q ),
   \]+++
and let $ A^\bullet = \oplus_k A^k $ 
be the singly graded object associated to the double complex 
$ \CCC^\bullet(\UUU,\Omega^\bullet) $.  It is a complex with respect
to the operator $ D $.  

.Definition {counter:definition}

_The algebraic de Rham cohomology of $ X $, $ H^\bullet_{DR}(X) $
is the cohomology of the complex $ A^\bullet $._

==== The Fundamental Class of Projective Space

Let $ \set{U, V} $ be the "standard" open cover of $ \PP^1 $ with coordinates
$ u $ and $ v $, where $ uv = 1 $ on $ U \cap V $. Consider the Cech-deRham
cocycle given by the holomorphic form
+++\[   
  \omega = \Set{ \frac{du}{u} }_{U \cap V}
   \]+++
on $ U \cap V $.
It has Cech degree one,  de Rham degree one, and total degree two,
hence defines an element of $ H^2_{DR, alg}(\PP^1,\QQ) $. 

.Theorem {counter:theorem}
[[th:fundamentalclassp1]]
--
_The generator  of $ H^2_{DR, alg}(\PP^1,\QQ) $
defined above satisfies_
+++\[    
  \int_{\PP^1} \omega = 2\pi \sqrt{-1}.
   \]+++
--

.Proof
--
The idea is to compute
a representative of $ \omega \in H^2_{DR, C^\infty}(\PP^1,\CC) $.  To
this end, choose a partition of unity $ \set{\rho_U, \rho_V} $ such
that $ \rho_U $ is identically zero near $ u = 0 $ and is identical one near
$ v = 0 $.  Consider the cocycle
+++\[   
  \omega'  = \omega + D\phi, 
   \]+++
where
+++\[   
 \phi = \Set{ \frac{\rho_U du}{u}, \frac{\rho_V dv}{v} }_{U,V} 
   \]+++
and where $ D = d  + (-1)^p\delta $ is the total differential.  Since
+++\[   
\delta \phi = 
 \frac{\rho_U du}{u}- \frac{\rho_V dv}{v} = \omega ,
   \]+++
we have
+++\[   
  \omega' = d\phi = 
\Set{ d\rho_U\frac{du}{u},  d\rho_V\frac{dv}{v} }_{U,V}
   \]+++
Note that
+++\[   
  \delta \omega' = 
\Set{ d\rho_U\wedge \frac{du}{u} - d\rho_V\wedge \frac{dv}{v} }_{U \cap V}\\
=
\Set{ d(\rho_U+ \rho_V)\wedge \frac{du}{u} }_{U \cap V} \\= 0,
   \]+++
so that $ \omega' $ is a cocycle (as it must be). 

Let us compute the integral
+++\[   
   \int_{\PP^1} \omega = \int_{\PP^1} \omega' = 
\int_U d\rho_U\wedge \frac{du}{u}.
   \]+++
Suppose that $ \rho_U $ has be chosen to be identically zero for $ |u| < 1 $
and identically equal to one for $ |u| > 2 $.  Then the integral in question
is
+++\[   
  \int_{1 < |u| < 2} d\rho_U \frac{du}{u}.
   \]+++
By Stokes' theorem, this surface integral is the same as the line integral
+++\[   
  \int_{|u|= 2} \rho_U \frac{du}{u} - 
 \int_{|u|= 1} \rho_U \frac{du}{u}
   \]+++
The second term is zero, since $ \rho_U = 0 $ on $ |u| = 1 $.  The first
integral is the
+++\[   
   \int_{|u|= 2} \frac{du}{u} = 2\pi\sqrt{-1}.
   \]+++

== Scratch 


Let $ X_i $ be the the set of $ i $-cells of $ X $.  Given a closed $ i $-cell
cell $ \bar e \subset X $, consider the pair $  (X, X - \bar e) $
and the map
+++\[   
   X \map (X, X - \bar e)
   \]+++
By excision, 
+++\[   
  H_\bullet(X,X-\bar e) \cong H_\bullet(\bar e, \partial e).

This graded group is free abelian with one generator in dimension
$ i $.  Thus
+++\[   
  H_\bullet(\bar e, \partial e) \cong \ZZ e,

where $ e $ is viewed as an abstract generator of degree $ i $.
