== Some Equations


=== Number Theory

The equation
stem:[a^2 + b^2 = c^2] has infinitely many 
non-proportional integer solutions. 
The integer solutions of the equation
[stem]
++++
  a^3 + b^3 = c^3
++++
are trivial: at least one entry is
zero and the others are "obvious"

=== Calculus

++++

The fundamental theorem of calculus:
[stem]
++++
   \frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)
++++
 
=== Linear algebra

A matrix:
[stem]
++++
M = \left[
  \begin{array}{ c c } 
	 1 & 2 \\ 
	 3 & 4 
  \end{array} \right]
