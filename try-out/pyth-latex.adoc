== Diophantine Equations


The Pythagorean theorem states that 
if $a$ and $b$ are the altitude
and base of a right triangle,
then
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$,
where $c$ is the hypotenuse.
It was known in ancient times
that $a,b,c = 3,4,5$ are the
sides of a right triangle.
This example leads to the 
question of whether the 
"Pythagorean equation"
has other solutions.
The answer is, _yes indeed_,
as the result below asserts.

The equation
\[
  a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\]
has infinitely many non-proportional 
integer solutions.

It is natural to ask about solutions
to analogue of the Pythagorean 
equation, but with exponent 
higher than two.  Pierre Fermat
considered this problem and arrived
at the following conclusion.

[env.theorem#mu%fermat-eq]
--
The only solution in the integers
of the equation
\[
  a^3 + b^3 = c^3
\]
are the obvious ones in which one
of the variables is zero.

These results constitute the
foundation of the subject of Diophantine equations.
